## Welcome to my lab notebook!

My name is Kathleen, I joined the Roberts Lab at the University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) in September 2023 to pursue my PhD. I'm broadly interested in understanding how marine invertebrates respond to stress, with a focus on different types of epigenetic modification (methylation, ncRNAs, etc.). You can see what I'm working on right now at the top-right corner!
