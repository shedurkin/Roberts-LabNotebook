See details in other posts in this project directory.\n\nSince the second survivorship trial I have kept all surviving oysters in their individual containers on benchtop in a standard lab room (maintained at 18-20C). I changed the water in each cup regularly, maintaing a roughly 1:6 ratio of oyster: water volume. Water used was dechlorinated tap water mixed with Instant Ocean to \\~25psu salinity. Notably, no algae or either food has been added during water changes -- the oysters were last fed just before Survivorship Round 2 (August 9 2024). For the first few weeks I changed the water every 1-2 days. Once I felt sure that latent effect of the survivorship trial had presented themselves I began extending the time between water changes to \\~1 week. I noticed little change in mortality following the increased time between water changes, so I'm assuming there is sufficient ambient air-water exchange to prevent asphyxiation between changes.\n\nGeneral observations (see details in pictures and paper lab notebook):\n\n-   After a few weeks some oysters began losing color in their shells, with the brown exterior layer flaking off into their water.\n\n-   A few oysters eventually developed brown-colored water between changes, with a foul smell. This generally preceded mortality.\n\n-   One oyster (India 03) had cloudy water during mortality checks and water changes on 09/11. I sampled and checked under the scope and *think* I may have seen sperm (but, since there was no movement, it's hard to be sure). This was following a warm few days, which also increased temps in the lab, so I think India 03 may have spawned.\n\n## Summary\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#####################\n### Load Packages ###\n#####################\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n#################\n### Load Data ###\n#################\n\nround2 <- read.csv(\"../../../../../Data/Pacific_oysters/2024_11_09_Survivorship_Round2.csv\")\n\n####################\n### Data Munging ###\n####################\n\n# Convert mort_date to Date format\nround2 <- round2 %>%\n  mutate(mort_date = as.Date(mort_date, format=\"%m/%d/%Y\"))\n\n# Calculate the total number of original samples in each group\ngroup_totals <- round2 %>%\n  group_by(group) %>%\n  summarise(total_samples = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Generate a sequence of dates covering the entire period\ndate_seq <- seq(min(round2$mort_date, na.rm = TRUE), max(round2$mort_date, na.rm = TRUE), by = \"day\")\n# Add the date before start of experiment, to show original 0% mortality\ndate_seq <- c(as.Date(\"2024-08-08\"), date_seq)\n\n# Create a data frame with all combinations of treatment group and date\nround2_full <- expand.grid(group = unique(round2$group), \n                           date = date_seq)\n\n# Aggregate the data by group and date to get daily death counts\nround2_daily <- round2 %>%\n  group_by(group, mort_date) %>%\n  summarise(deaths = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  rename(date = mort_date)\n\n# Join the aggregated daily deaths with the full date range\nround2_cumulative <- round2_full %>%\n  left_join(round2_daily, by = c(\"group\", \"date\")) %>%\n  mutate(deaths = ifelse(is.na(deaths), 0, deaths)) %>%  # Replace NA with 0 for days with no deaths\n  group_by(group) %>%\n  arrange(date) %>%\n  mutate(cumulative_deaths = cumsum(deaths)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Join with group totals to calculate cumulative deaths as a percentage\nround2_cumulative <- round2_cumulative %>%\n  left_join(group_totals, by = \"group\") %>%\n  mutate(cumulative_death_percentage = (cumulative_deaths / total_samples) * 100)\n\n# retrieve metadata associated with groups\nmetadata <- round2 %>%\n  select(group, cattle_tag, round1_treatment, round2_treatment) %>%\n  distinct()\n\nround2_cumulative_metadata <- round2_cumulative %>%\n  left_join(metadata, by = \"group\")\n\n################\n### Plot Data ##\n################\n\nlabels_df <- round2_cumulative_metadata %>%\n  group_by(group) %>%\n  filter(date == max(date)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(round2_cumulative_metadata, aes(x = date, y = cumulative_death_percentage, group = group, color = round1_treatment)) +\n  #geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ round2_treatment) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = labels_df, aes(label = group), size = 2.5, nudge_x = 0.3, check_overlap = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative mortality from Survivorship Round 2\",\n       x = \"Time\",\n       y = \"Cumulative mortality (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024_11_08_diptrip_updates_summary_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs of 8/22 we're sitting at roughly 50% mortality in the round 2 stressed oysters and roughly 10% mortality in the controls. Interestingly, while there doesn't appear to be any difference among the original hardening groups, the round 1 survivorship does seem to have had a hardening effect!\n\nSeveral possible explanations for this observation:\n\nThe original hardening did have an effect, but it was too subtle to see with our reduced sample sizes\n\nThe original hardening was too long ago -- it's effects were short-term and are no longer manifest, 4 weeks later\n\nThe original hardening was performed at too low a temperature to see an effect at 42C stress. The original hardening was done at 35C, while survivorship round 1 was at 42C, the same temperature the oysters then experienced during this survivorship round. My brief review of other papers that attempted hardening in bivalves did suggest that hardening was most effective when conditions were similar to those the organism would experience during an extreme stress event post-hardening\n\n",
