Will also run some old extractions to check whether they've degraded since first being extracted.\n\nThis time since I expect my 1800s samples to have essentially no HMW DNA, will use an **HS D5000 tape** instead of a gDNA tape.\n\nHS D5000 tape requires 2uL of DNA sample. I want to conserve my extractions, and the HS D5000 tape can handle very low concentrations, so I'll be using a 2x dilution for all samples (1uL extraction + 1uL Zymo EB)\n\nFollowed HS D5000 protocol found [here](./protocols/Agilent_4200_D5000_QuickGuide.pdf).\n\n**Tapestation layout:**\n\n|     | 1           | 2       |\n|-----|-------------|---------|\n| A   | Ladder      | 1740363 |\n| B   | 50368 (new) | 51892   |\n| C   | 50603 (new) | 51732   |\n| D   | 19054 (new) | 14399   |\n| E   | 14399 (new) | 50368   |\n| F   | 42137 (new) | 50603   |\n| G   | 1606826     |         |\n| H   | 1740336     |         |\n\n[Full tapestation report](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/kdurkin1/SIFP_2025/TapeStation/2025_09_04_summary.pdf).\n\n[**Notes:**]{.underline}\n\n-   Looks like 50368 (new), 42137 (new), and 14399 (new) are by far the best 1800s re-extractions to use for sequencing.\n\n-   Don't see an immediately obvious degradation issue comparing new to old extractions of 50368, 50603, 14399, will need to compare to OG tapestation.\n",
