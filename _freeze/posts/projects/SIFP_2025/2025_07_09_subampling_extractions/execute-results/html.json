Since both old (\\>100 yo) and modern (\\<25 yo) specimens are limited, will be sampling all of those available (\\~10 specimens each). There is a high number of specimens collected in the 1960s and 1970s (50-60 yo), and these specimens are quite large, providing abundant material, so this will be my \"midpoint\". Since both the oldest and most recent collections were mostly performed in the Florida/Bahamas region of the Caribbean (see [last post](./2025_07_08_specimen_selection2.qmd) for geographic distribution details), I will also endeavor to select 1960s-1970s specimens collected from the same region.\n\nSelected \\~10 specimens from each rough time period of collection\n\n[**1880s-1910s:**]{.underline}**\\\n**USNM 50368\\\nUSNM 1207569\\\n**USNM 14366\\\nUSNM 14366**\\\nUSNM 14399\\\nUSNM 19054\\\nUSNM 42137\\\nUSNM 52026\\\nUSNM 1180630\\\nUSNM 50603\\\nUSNM 52295\n\n::: callout-warning\nThere are two collections with the same catalog number, USNM 14366, and this duplication exists in the inventory database as well...\n\nAfter pulling the specimens, there's only one bag labelled USNM 14366.\n:::\n\n[**1960s - 1970s:**]{.underline}**\\\n**USNM 51727\\\nUSNM 51729\\\nUSNM 51857\\\nUSNM 51858\\\nUSNM 51859\\\nUSNM 51860\\\nUSNM 51861\\\nUSNM 51892\\\n\n[**2000s - 2010s:**]{.underline}**\\\n**USNM 100609\\\nUSNM 100610\\\nUSNM 1007393\\\nUSNM 1018355\\\nUSNM 1606824\\\nUSNM 1606826\\\nUSNM 1740336\\\nUSNM 1740363\\\nUSNM 1740390\\\nUSNM 1740407\n\n### Subsampling\n\nSubsampled using protocol described in [July 8, 2025 post](./2025_07_08_specimen_selection2.qmd).\n\nNotes:\n\n-   Couldn't find two of the old specimens (noted below). Emailed Andrea their catalog numbers.\n\n-   Found 2 *E. tayrona* specimens that were misplaced in the *E. tourneforti* drawers while pulling specimens. I replaced them in the *E. tayrona* drawer. USNM 101774 was found in R19, C334, D11, and USNM 1018426 in R19, C334, D05. both were moved to *E. tayrona* drawer, R19, C334, D05.\n\n-   USNM 14366 has two entries in the inventory database, but only one bag of specimens in the collection\n\n-   USNM 14366 and USNM 14399 both have multiple individuals in the single specimen bag. In neither case were individuals separately labelled, so I just subsampled one of those at the top of the bag.\n\n### Extractions\n\nBegan digestions. Digestions unfortunately split over two days because I couldn't access LAB after I finished the last of the subsampling.\n\nExtractions performed with Qiagen DNEasy Kit. Protocol slightly modified for use with archival dried coral specimens.\n\n[**Digestion Protocol:**]{.underline}\n\n1.  Begin with small, cut/crushed quantity of dried tissue in a 1.5mL snap-cap tube.\n\n2.  Add 180uL Buffer ATL and **40uL proteinase K\\*.** Mix by vortexing and incubate at for **\\~48hr\\*** on a heated shaker, set to 56C and 80 RPM.\n\n    **\\* indicates modification to standard protocol**\n\nFirst round of digestions began incubating 7/9/2025 at 5:00pm:\n\n-   USNM 14366, USNM 14366, USNM 14399, USNM 19054, USNM 42137, USNM 52026, USNM 1180630, USNM 52295, USNM 51728, USNM
