Selected all options (6mA, 5mC, & 5hmC in all contexts)\n\n-   Run sequencing on *un-primed, un-loaded* Flow cell for 4 min to evaluate pore health.\n\n-   really weird run stats... only 36 pores available on pore scan, almost everything shows \"no pore\"...\n\n-   Paused to prime + load.\n\n-   Okay, after priming + loading, resumed run: Initiated pore scan - 1430 pores\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n-   Seeing some \"wild flowering\" in the channel states panel early on\n\n-   Occupancy is looking good in first \\~15min! ✛ e.g. 47% sequencing, 4.8% available, so (47 / 47 + 4.8) = 90.1%! That's my highest proportion yet of available pores that are actively sequencing\n\n-   There's a notably higher level of adapter than in previous runs - \\~7%, compared to previous 1%-2% in MinION runs. This might be expected though, since library is shorter than previous libraries, which means the proportion of adapter:read will be higher\n\n[**Wash #1**]{.underline} \\\n\\@ 4.5hr in, after \\~ ⅔ pore loss (**510 pores** \\@ the 3.5hr scan). Very fast pore loss, mostly to the \"unavailable\" category. Re-loaded w/ 300 fmol again. **783 pores** after wash #1\n\n[**Wash #2**]{.underline} \\\n\\@ 19.5hr in, **84 pores** remaining. Re-loaded with 300 fmol, and there are **381 pores** after wash/reload.\n\n[**Wash #3**]{.underline} \\\n\\@ 2 days 1hr in, **40 pores** remaining. Re-loaded with 300 fmol. Run errored out when I tried to resume, so I had to restart the MinKnow software and start a new run. **185 pores** after run started.\n",
