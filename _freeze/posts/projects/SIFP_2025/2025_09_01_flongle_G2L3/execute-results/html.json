Avg. length is \\~700bp, and G2L3 library is 15.3ng/uL = 35.48fmol/uL\n\n$$\n\\frac{10fmol}{5uL\\ EB}\\ = \\ \\frac{25.48fmol}{17.74uL\\ EB}\n$$\n\nSo mix **1uL G2L3** with (17.74-1) = **16.74uL EB**\n\n[**Flongle flow cell:**]{.underline}\\\nID: AYK963\\\n89 pores on 8/13/25 check\\\n86 pores on today's pore check\\\n66 pores after loading\n\nI've noticed the Flongle flow cells lose a lot of pores during loading, and community posts suggest this is a) common, and b) related to the ONT loading protocol being too harsh. This time I tried using the community-developed [gentle negative pressure loading protocol](./protocols/Flow_Cell_Loading_Flongle_2025-Jun-12.pdf) for Flongles.\n\nI still lost almost 25% of pores, but that's better than last time (G3L1 Flongle), when I lost almost 50% of pores. I was also extra careful to seal the cover tape around all ports after loading.\n\n[**Notes:**]{.underline}\n\nBarcode 24 is low, but that sample had a high proportion of reads in the G2L2 MinION run, so maybe this will help offset. Think its ok to run on a MinION.\n",
