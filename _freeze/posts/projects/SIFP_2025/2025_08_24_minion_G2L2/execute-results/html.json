Loading flow cell with 200fmol DNA, after seeing higher pore occupancy with this amount (in comparison to 100fmol).\n\nNeed 200fmol DNa in 12uL EB. G2L2 is **24.2ng/uL**, so 200fmol of 700bp DNA is **86.24ng**.\n\n$$\n\\frac{86.24ng}{24.2\\frac{ng}{uL}} = 3.56uL G2L2 \\ \\ \\ \\rightarrow \\ \\ \\ use\\ 3.5uL\\ G2L2\n$$\n\nSo mix **3.5uL G2L2** with **8.5uL EB**.\n\n[**Flow cell:**]{.underline}\\\nID: FBD39370\\\n1482 pores on pore check\\\n1400 pores after priming and loading\n\nStarted run at 10:26pm 8/24/25. Based on MinION G1L4, expect half-life of the pores to be \\~12 hrs, so I'll be back in office tomorow morning at around that time. If at 1/2 pore loss by then, will likely wash.\n\nAt 20minutes into the run, looking good! Pore activity bars are all stable, with 49.7% sequencing and 13.4% available (so \\~80% of available pores are sequencing).\n\n[**Washes:**]{.underline}\n\nWash #1 at 13hr into run. Re-loaded with 200fmol G2L2. 224 pores -\\> 867 pores/\n\nWash #2 at 23hr in. Reloaded with 200fmol G2L2. 238 pores -\\> 563 pores\n\nWash #3 at 1 day 12 hr into run. Actally had to fully stop run to allow for a mandatory computer update (took \\~5min), then restarted \"new run\", confirmed flow cell was still sequencing, then paused, washed, reloaded, and let run for remaining 36 hours. 212 pores -\\> 410 pores. Out of G2L2, so could only load \\~100fmol (2uL G2L2 plus 10uL EB).\n",
