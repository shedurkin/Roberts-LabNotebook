Then inserted flongle flow cell and performed flow cell check.\n\n[**Flongle flow cell:**]{.underline}\\\nID: AYW871\\\n61 pores on first pore check\\\n57 pores on this pore check\n\nAccording to TapeStation peaks these samples are \\~700bp in avg fragment length. Thus, the recommended Flongle loading amount of 5-10fmol is roughly equivalent to 2.16ng - 4.31ng.\n\nI loaded the Flongle with 10fmol (4.31ng) of Group 2 Library 1 in 5uL of EB. G2L1 concentration is too high to accurately pipette 4.31ng, so instead mixed:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4.3ng\\ DNA}{5uL\\ EB} = \\frac{20ng\\ DNA}{23.3uL\\ EB}\\ \\ \\ Added\\ 1uL\\ G2L1\\ to\\ (23.3-1)=22.3uL\\ EB\n$$\n",
