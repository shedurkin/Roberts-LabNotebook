I previously diluted a portion of G1L4 to 100fmol/12uL, in a total of 36uL. I used 12uL of this for the first load, so I now have 24uL of diluted library. I also still have some undiluted Library 4. I need to add some undiluted Library 4 to my dilution to raise the concentration to 200fmol/12uL (since I observed higher pore occupancy with more input DNA).\n\n[Calculate how many uL of undiluted Library 4 to add:]{.underline}\n\nA = concentration of Library 4 = 36.6 ng/uL\\\nB = concentration of dilution = 100fmol/12uL = 43.1ng/12uL = 3.58 ng/uL\\\nv = volume of dilution = 24uL\\\nx = volume of Library 4\n\n$\\frac{total\\ DNA}{total\\ volume} = \\frac{(Bv+Ax)}{v+x} = 2B \\ \\ \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\ \\ x(A-2B)=Bv \\ \\ \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\ \\ x=\\frac{Bv}{A-2B}$\n\n$x=\\frac{Bv}{A-2B} = \\frac{3.58\\frac{ng}{uL}*24uL}{36.6\\frac{ng}{uL}-2*3.58\\frac{ng}{uL}} = \\frac{85.92ng}{29.44\\frac{ng}{uL}} = 2.92uL$\n\nAdded 2.92uL of undiluted G1L4 to the MinION dilution to bring the concentration up to 200fmol/12uL. this is twice the recommended concentration for MinION loading.\n\nI then used this newdilution to wash and reload the Group 1 Library 4 flow cell.\n\n541 pores (129 reserved, 412 available) before wash, 693 pores (255 reserved, 438 available)\n",
