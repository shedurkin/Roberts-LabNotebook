I again made the library with 2X the recommended concentration (200fmol DNA instead of 100fmol DNA). After reloading, resumed the run.\n\nAfter resuming the run, the flow cell was back to 845 pores, though on pore scan 293 of those were \"reserved\", so I'm not sure how many of the recovered pores will actually be sequencing.\n\nBefore wash, pore activity showed:\n\n-   15.6% of pores sequencing, 15.7% available\\\n    So 30% of pores still live, and 50% occupancy of available pores\n\nAfter wash/reload, pore activity showed:\n\n-   30.8% sequencing, 20.2% available\\\n    So 51% of pores stil ive, and \\~60% pore occupancy of those available\n\n[**Notes:**]{.underline}\n\n-   Barcodes are unbalanced (#12: 1.3M, #13: 1.5M, #14: 2.5M), so there may have been an issue during barcode ligation. Maybe the barcodes weren't fully mixed before ligation? Maybe the sample concentrations are inaccurate?\n\n-   1/2 life of pores is \\~11hrs. At 0hr, 1383 pores, at 11hr, 704 pores.\n",
