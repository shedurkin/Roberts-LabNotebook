Since I'm not exactly sure what bead ratio will work best to remove \\<300bp fragments from my samples, I'll be trying a \"titration\" trial of several ratios.\n\nFor this trial I'll be using two mid-age samples with high DNA concentrations but a \"smeary\", wide range of fragment sizes:\n\n| Catalog Number | Concentration (ng/uL) | Gel size distribution |\n|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| USNM 51732     | 89.4                  | smeared, 0.3kb        |\n| USNM 51892     | 86.3                  | smeared, 0.15kb       |\n\nThe KAPA Pure Beads protocol recommends a bead-to-sample ratio of 0.9X - 0.7X to retain fragments \\>250bp - \\> 350bp. I'll test three ratios across this range.\n\nWill be doing cleanup in 0.2mL strip tubes, so will need to assign short labels:\n\n|                | 0.7X | 0.8X | 0.9X |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| **USNM 51732** | A.7  | A.8  | A.9  |\n| **USNM 51892** | B.7  | B.8  | B.9  |\n\nFollowed the [KAPA Pure Beads protocol](./protocols/KAPA-Pure-Beads-Technical-Data-Sheet.pdf) (#2, Cleanup of Fragmented DNA in NGS Workflow), with the following notes/modifications:\n\n-   Mixed **fresh aliquot of 80% EtOH** using nuclease-free water. It is important to mix a fresh aliquot each time, since EtOH can absorb atmospheric water, slightly changing the concentration over time.\n\n-   For each rxn, used 5uL NA and diluted to 20uL using Zymo Elution Buffer (**5uL DNA** + **15uL Zymo Elution Buffer**)\n\n-   With 20uL DNA, the bead volumes for each bead-to-sample ratio are as follows:\n\n    **0.7X:** 20uL DNA + **14uL KAPA Pure Beads\\\n    0.8X:** 20uL DNA + **16uL KAPA Pure Beads\\\n    0.9X** 20uL DNA + **18uL KAPA Pure Beads**\n\n-   First incubation (step 2.4) for 10 minutes\n\n-   Dried beads (step 2.13) for 4 minutes\n\n-   Re-eluted DNA (step 2.15) in **20uL Zymo Elution Buffer**. Note that this means the **DNA is now diluted by a factor of 4.** So my samples, which had concentrations of \\~90ng/uL, will now have bead-cleaned concentrations of \\~22ng/uL (not accounting for DNA loss during the cleanup process)\n\n-   Incubated eluting DNA (step 2.16) for 8 minutes\n",
