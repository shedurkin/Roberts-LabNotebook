The general outline of this process, in full, is:\n\n-   Recall all the MinION `.pod5` files (quality-passed only) using `Dorado`, including both alignment to the *E. knighti* genome and modified basecalling for 5mCG, 5hmCG, and 6mA modifications (note that only 5mC and 5hmC *found in a CG context* were basecalled). Outputs are BAM files.\n\n-   From those, separate by barcode and isolate only mapped reads, so I end up with one BAM file per barcode that contains only the reads with that barcode that mapped to the *E. knighti* genome*.*\n\n-   Then, use `modkit` `summary` to summarize the presence of each modification type. This is *global modification*, e.g. % of all A nucleotides in the BAM file that have the 6mA modification. I performed `modkit summary` on both the un-separated BAM files and on the barcodes individually, saved outputs, and plotted (e.g. the below plot, taken from G4L2)\n\n    ![](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/D-Group4/code/04.01-G4-Library2-MinION-Dorado-recall-GPU_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png?raw=true)\n\nKnitted code and plots for each sequencing run linked below:\\\n[Group 1, Library 4, MinION (2019 vouchers)](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/A-Group1/code/06.01-G1-Library4-MinION-Dorado-recall-GPU.md)\\\n[Group 2, Library 2, MinION (1960s vouchers)](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/B-Group2/code/04.01-G2-Library2-MinION-Dorado-recall-GPU.md)\\\n[Group 2, Library 3, MinION (1960s vouchers)](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/B-Group2/code/05.01-G2-Library3-MinION-Dorado-recall-GPU.md)\\\n[Group 4, Library , MinION (pre-1900 vouchers)](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/D-Group4/code/03.01-G4-Library1-MinION-Dorado-recall-GPU.md)\\\n[Group 4, Library , MinION (pre-1900 vouchers)](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/D-Group4/code/04.01-G4-Library2-MinION-Dorado-recall-GPU.md)\n\n## Plotting\n\nThen generated a *bunch* of summary plots potentially useful for the presentation, including visualizations of output, quality, modifications, etc. Code writing supported with Claude Sonnet AI. Of particular interest might be plots of specimen output, quality, and modification %s *by age*, to highlight issues with sequencing older specimens.\n\nKnitted code, with plots, found here: [03-nobones-plotting](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/M-multi-group/code/03-nobones-plotting.md)\n\n![](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/M-multi-group/code/03-nobones-plotting_files/figure-gfm/fig-age-group-summary-1.png?raw=true)\n\n![](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/M-multi-group/code/03-nobones-plotting_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png?raw=true)\n\n![](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/M-multi-group/code/03-nobones-plotting_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png?raw=true)\n\n![](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/M-multi-group/code/03-nobones-plotting_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-3.png?raw=true)\n\n## Additional analyses\n\nFinally, did some additional data processing. Namely, summarized per-base modifications. Currently have BAM files that show the base called, with and without modifications, for every single read. `pileup` will summarize these down to BED files that show, for every position in the genome, the % modification (if applicable). Performed this by specimen (barcode), so for specimens that were sequenced multiple times all the data is combined.\n\nKnitted code: [04-specimen-pileup](https://github.com/shedurkin/SIFP-nanopore/blob/main/M-multi-group/code/04-specimen-pileup.md)\n",
