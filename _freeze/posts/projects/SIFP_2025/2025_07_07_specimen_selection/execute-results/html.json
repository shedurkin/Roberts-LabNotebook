The criteria are:\n\n-   Octocoral species, since these have generally extracted better for Andrea than old stony corals\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n-   Specimens available for a range of collection dates spanning \\~100 years, including a modern collection (within the last \\~20 years)\n\n-   A well-annotated genome is available for the species (or a very close relative)\n\nWith these criteria in mind, Andrea suggested a few octocoral species that have high-quality genome annotations:\n\n-   *Eunicea knighti*: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_965233905.1/>\n\n-   *Leptogorgia sarmentosa*: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_964658295.1/>\n\n-   *Gorgonia ventalina*: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_964194065.1/>\n\n### Inventory search\n\nFor *Eunicea* and *Leptogorgia*, the museum doesn't have significant collection of the species with annotated genomes. However, they may have more abundant material from a close relative. To check this, I searched the [collections inventory](https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/) for the two genera, including a filter for only collections that were preserved and stored \"Dry\", and downloaded the results as CSVs. I also did the same for *G. ventalina* to get a sense of how many specimens we have of this species across a range of collection dates.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nG_ventalina <- read.csv(\"./data/G_ventalina_nmnhsearch-20250707155748.csv\")\nEunicea <- read.csv(\"./data/Eunicea_nmnhsearch-20250707190456.csv\")\nLeptogorgia <- read.csv(\"./data/Leptogorgia_nmnhsearch-20250707205311.csv\")\n\n# format data\n\n# Extract year from the inconsistently formatted \"Date.Collected\" column\n# This command should just extract the first 4-digit number in each entry\nG_ventalina$Year.Collected <- as.numeric(sub(\".*(\\\\d{4}).*\", \"\\\\1\", G_ventalina$Date.Collected))\nEunicea$Year.Collected <- as.numeric(sub(\".*(\\\\d{4}).*\", \"\\\\1\", Eunicea$Date.Collected))\nLeptogorgia$Year.Collected <- as.numeric(sub(\".*(\\\\d{4}).*\", \"\\\\1\", Leptogorgia$Date.Collected))\n\n# Reduce scientifc names to just species names\ncleaned_Eunicea <- gsub(\"\\\\s*\\\\([^\\\\)]+\\\\)\", \"\", Eunicea$Scientific.Name)\nEunicea$Species.Clean <- sub(\"^((\\\\S+)\\\\s+(\\\\S+)).*$\", \"\\\\1\", cleaned_Eunicea)\n\ncleaned_Leptogorgia <- gsub(\"\\\\s*\\\\([^\\\\)]+\\\\)\", \"\", Leptogorgia$Scientific.Name)\nLeptogorgia$Species.Clean <- sub(\"^((\\\\S+)\\\\s+(\\\\S+)).*$\", \"\\\\1\", cleaned_Leptogorgia)\n\n\n# Check one of the year columns\n#head(G_ventalina %>% select(Date.Collected, Year.Collected))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(Eunicea, aes(x = Year.Collected)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, boundary = 1850, fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  xlab(\"Year Collected\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of Entries\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Species.Clean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2025_07_07_specimen_selection_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(Leptogorgia, aes(x = Year.Collected)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, boundary = 1850, fill = \"purple4\", color = \"black\") +\n  xlab(\"Year Collected\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of Entries\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Species.Clean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2025_07_07_specimen_selection_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooks like the three species in the *Eunicea* and *Leptogorgia* genera with decent number of specimens are:\n\n-   *E. flexuosa*\n\n-   *E. tourneforti*\n\n-   *L. alba*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(Eunicea[Eunicea$Species.Clean %in% c(\"Eunicea flexuosa\",\"Eunicea tourneforti\"),], aes(x = Year.Collected)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, boundary = 1850, fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  xlab(\"Year Collected\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of Entries\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Species.Clean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2025_07_07_specimen_selection_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(Leptogorgia[Leptogorgia$Species.Clean == \"Leptogorgia alba\",], aes(x = Year.Collected)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, boundary = 1850, fill = \"purple4\", color = \"black\") +\n  xlab(\"Year Collected\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of Entries\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2025_07_07_specimen_selection_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBoth of the *Eunicea* species have multiple specimens from the turn of the century (\\~1900) and from modern collections, so I'll take a look at the corals themselves to try to get a sense of material quantity/quality. For the potentially promising *Leptogorgia* (*L. alba*), there's only one specimen from before 1900, and none within the last 25 years, so we wouldn't be able to cover multiple timepoints. **I'm going to exclude *Leptogorgia spp*. from consideration.**\n\nAlso check availability of *G. ventalina.*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(G_ventalina, aes(x = Year.Collected)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, boundary = 1880, fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  xlab(\"Year Collected\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of Entries\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1860, 2020, by = 20)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 20, by = 2)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2025_07_07_specimen_selection_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Observations from collections search:\n\n**E. flexuosa**\n\n-   All dried specimens have retained natural color (rust-brown), confirming they were not bleached in the preservation process -- this is ideal for us!\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n-   Abundant material from late-1800s (\\~1885-1900) collections. 15-20 individuals, most specimens are quite large, \\~1ft in diameter.\n\n-   Quite a bit of material from mid-1900s (1945-1959), with \\~15 large individuals\n\n-   A *ton* of material from collections between 1960 and 1972, \\~30 large specimens, some very large. This might be an ideal \"middle\" timepoint.\n\n-   The only \"modern\" collections I see are 6 specimens collected in in the last 25 years (2000, 2002, 2004, and 2019), and they're all very small, just a couple inches in length and not fully branching. I'd have to be very careful and judicious when subsampling these.\n\n**E. tourneforti**\n\n::: callout-note\nIn the museum database, there are two different attributions used for *E. tourneforti*:\n\n-   Eunicea tourneforti atra Verrill, 1901\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n-   Eunicea tourneforti tourneforti Milne Edwards & Haime, 1857\n\nIs there a difference? Has the species been revised?\n:::\n\n-   *E. tourneforti* may be a better Eunicea species to work with because it is more closely related to the species for which we have a high-quality genome, *E. knighti* (@d17030173)\n\n    ![Eunicea phylogeny (maximum likelihood, based on reduced representation sequencing) (Sarmiento et al. 2025)](images/Eunicea_tree.png)\n\n-   The branches of *E. tournefortini* are much thicker than those of *E. flexuosa*, which may prove beneficial for successfully extracting DNA\n\n-   Several specimens (5-10) from the turn of the century, all of a good size (6-12 inches in length, branching)\n\n-   \\~30 specimens from 1960s and 1970s, all with plenty of material (\\~1ft in length, branching). As with *E. flexuosa*, this seems like an ideal \"mid-age\" timepoint.\n\n-   6 from early 2000s collections (2002, 2009). All are quite small, just a few inches in length and not very branched. Two, however, are quite thick, so contain more material.\n\n-   Another 6 from 2019 collection (thanks Prof McFadden!). As in others, these specimens are short (\\~3 inches) and unbranched, but much thicker than the *E. flexuosa* counterparts. One is actually a bit larger too, \\~6 inches long and forked.\n\n**G. ventalina**\n\n-   Little material from turn-of the century. I saw 2 specimens from before 1900, and both were very small, maybe 2 inches in diameter -- I would be really worried about destructively sampling these, expecially because the lacy growth form of *G. ventalina* means there's less tissue by surface area, so I may need to take more. There were 3 specimens from early 1900s, and these were larger (6-12 inches in diameter). One, however, was almost white -- a contrast to the dark purple color of the other specimens -- which suggested to me it may have either been treated (i.e. bleached) or more degraded.\n\n-   As in the other species, plenty of specimens (30-40) and material (\\~1ft in diameter) from the 1960s and 70s.\n\n-   Very little modern material, I only saw 2-3 small specimens from the early 2000s.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWe don't have a sufficient range of collection dates of any *Leptogorgia* species, and both the very old and very recent specimens of *G. ventalina* are potentially too small for subsampling. This leaves one of the *Eunicea* species, using the *E. knighti* genome as reference. Both *E. flexuosa* and *E. tourneforti* have sufficient material from an appropriate range of collection dates. However, *E. tourneforti* is more closely related to our reference *E. knighti*; has more specimens and material available for the critical modern reference; and is thicker, potentially providing more tissue for extraction. Because of these considerations, **I think *E. tourneforti* is the best choice!**\n",
