Digestions began 09/01/25 7pm, pulled digestions 09/04/25 \\~7am. See digestion details [here](./2025_09_01_reextractions.qmd).\n\nFollowed Qiagen DNEasy extraction protocol found [here](2025_07_11_extractions.qmd).\n\nSamples: 50368, 50603, 19054, 14399, 42137.\n\n[**Notes:**]{.underline}\n\n-   Eluted in 100uL Qiagen AE\n\n-   50368 has lots of big sclerites.\n\nAfter Qiagen extraction, immediately cleaned extractions using the Zymo Genomic DNA Clean and Concentrate Kit. Followed protocol included [here](2025_07_12_zymo_cleanup.qmd).\n\nEluted in 50uL of 60C Zymo EB/\n\n[**Notes:**]{.underline}\n\n-   42137 had an almost black Qiagen extraction, but almost clear after Zymo!\n\n[**Qubit of Zymo-cleaned extractions:**]{.underline}\n\nUsed dsDNA 1X HS kit, followed protocol found [here](./2025_07_14_qubit.qmd), using 1uL of sample input.\n\nStandard 1: 35.68\\\nStandard 2: 16857.03\\\n50368: **84.0 ng/uL**\\\n50603: **9.72 ng/uL**\\\n19054: **1.58 ng/uL**\\\n14399: **30.8 ng/uL\\\n**42137: **54.0 ng/uL**\n\nNext step would normally be a gel, but I'm short on time and want to conserve DNA. Since I already know the KAPA bead-to-sample ratio I want to use, I'll go straight to bead clean/size selection.\n",
