I need to extract more DNa for 5 specimens:\n\n| Catalog \\# | Collection Year |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| 50603      | 1912            |\n| 19054      | 1898            |\n| 42137      | 1897            |\n| 14399      | 1886            |\n| 50368      | 1880            |\n\nSubsampled and began tissue digestion, as detailed [here](./2025_07_09_subampling_extractions.qmd).\n\nBegan digestion at 7:00pm, 09/01/2025, will run for \\~48hr.\n\n[**Notes:**]{.underline}\n\n-   A power outage interrupted digestion incubation. Incubator stopped at \\~9pm 09/02/25, and I restarted it \\~7am 09/03/25, so digestions were sitting at room temp for \\~10hrs.\n\n-   Spiked in 20uL proteinase K to each tube, will let digestions sit on shaking incubator for another 12-24hr.\n",
