This is because I'm using multiple rxns of priming and loading reagents for each MinION flow cell run, due to the wash/reloads and Flongle runs.\n\nNanopore offers \"sequencing expansions\" with these reagents, so I'll need to purchase one. 12 rxns would allow for additionsl 3 MinION runs, assuing 4 total loads for each cell (initial load, plus 3 wash/reloads).\n\nI'll adjust the total volume of priming mix I make during each loading, since the provided protocol makes and excess. I only need 1000uL for priming a MinION flow cell.\n\n| Priming Mix            | 1X       | 0.85X     |\n|------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Flow Cell Flush (FCF)  | 1162.5uL | 988.125uL |\n| BSA 20mg/mL            | 12.5uL   | 10.625uL  |\n| Flow Cell Tether (FCT) | 30uL     | 25.5uL    |\n| **Total**              | 1205uL   | 1024.25uL |\n\nWill begin making an 0.85X mix of priming mix every time I load.\n",
