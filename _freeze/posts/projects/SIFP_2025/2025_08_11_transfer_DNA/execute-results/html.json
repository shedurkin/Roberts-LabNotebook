To avoid constant freeze/thaw of all samples, I need them in individual, separate tubes, not the strip tubes they're currently in.\n\nPulled all DNA extractions from the freezer, thawed in fridge for \\~20min, then spun down and placed on ice. Labelled new tubes on cap and sides and arranged in rack in same positions/orientation as current sample layout. Didn't change the \"location\" of any samples. Transferred full volume of each sample from old strip tube spot to new labelled tube.\n\nPlaced all samples back in the -20C freezer once finished.\n",
