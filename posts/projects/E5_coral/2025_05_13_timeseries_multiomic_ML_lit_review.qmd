Now that I have a set of consistently well-predicted genes related to energetic state (see relevant posts [here](./2025_05_08_timeseries_multiomic_ML_3.qmd) and [here](./2025_05_12_timeseries_multiomic_ML_4.qmd)), I want to identify genes/predictive networks that may be of particular interest.

To facilitate that I'll do a literature search for each of the protein products of my gene set.

Grab the 28 consistently well-predicted energetic state genes and their annotations:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(DT)

highperf_FA <- read.csv("https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/raw/refs/heads/main/D-Apul/output/22.3-Apul-multiomic-machine-learning-byTP/energetic_state_highperf_FA.csv") %>% select(-X)

datatable(highperf_FA %>% select(gene, Protein.names), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

Here’s a concise summary of the functions of the listed genes, focusing on their roles in energy production, utilization, and storage (AI-assisted):

* **Energy Role:** Essential for mitochondrial energy metabolism; deficiencies can lead to accumulation of metabolic intermediates and impaired mitochondrial function. ([Wikipedia][1])

Its disregulation has been previously associated with a lncRNA (https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=LINC00484)
---

### 2. **FUN_004083 – Dipeptidyl Peptidase II (DPP II)**

* **Function:** Removes N-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides.
* **Energy Role:** Involved in protein turnover, indirectly influencing energy homeostasis. ([ScienceDirect][2])

In *Aptasia*, Dipeptidyl peptidase 2 proteins are less abundant in anemones colonized by symbionts (Sproles et al. 2019)

Various ncRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of dipeptidyl peptidase genes (though not DPP2 specifically)

### 3. **FUN_001160 – Carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A)**

* **Function:** Facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation.
* **Energy Role:** Crucial for fatty acid metabolism and energy production, especially during fasting. ([UniProt][3])

In aposymbiotic morphotypes of the coral *Fimbriaphyllia paradivisa*, CPT1A was rhythmically transcribed over 12-hour day/night cycles, suggesting its expression is influenced by symbiont interactions and daily light cycles (Aslett 2024) (https://reefranch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coral-Rhythms-Part-II.pdf)

* **Function:** Hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in lysosomes.
* **Energy Role:** Releases free cholesterol and fatty acids for cellular energy use and storage. ([PMC][4])

LALs have also been identified as in the tentacle transcriptomes of several hydrozoan and scyphozoan jellyfish, as well as in the venom glands of snakes, though their function in venom toxicity remains unclear (Doonan et al. 2019, Ponce et al. 2016)

In vertebrates and insects, cryptochromes are involved in regulation fo the circadian rhythm. 

In corals, cryptochromes are likely involved in photoreception. For example, in *Acropora millepora*, cryptochromes have been reported to be preferentially expressed in light, including some types showing differential expression based on lunar cycle, suggesting a potential role in behavior synchronization, such as mass spawning (Levy et al. 2007). 

In plants, cryptochrome expression is linked to expression of miRNA and lncRNA. For example, in the algae *Saccharina japonica*, expression of a type of cryptochrome is regulated by an miRNA and several lncRNA (Yang et al. 2020) (the implicated miRNA does not match Cluster_17173)

* **Function:** Part of the 26S proteasome complex, involved in protein degradation.
* **Energy Role:** Regulates protein turnover, influencing energy metabolism and cellular homeostasis.

26S proteasome regulatory subunit 6B is part of the multiprotein 26S proteasome complex, which removes misfolded or damaged proteins.

In Aptasia-associated symbionts, 26S proteasome regulatory subunit 6B is upregulated in response to both heat and salinity stress (and their interaction), as are many other types of proteasome subunits (Giovagnoli 2023)

* **Function:** A rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis.
* **Energy Role:** Key enzyme in glucose production from non-carbohydrate sources, maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting.

In corals, the PEPCK pathway has been identified as a potential carbon fixation pathway within coral hosts to supplement other CO2 concentrating mechanisms, used to accumulate dissolved organic carbon in service of their symbionts. (Zhang et al., 2024)

PEPCK is also differentially expressed under heat stress and bleaching (e.g., Kenkel et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2018, Kenkel et al. 2014), which suggests its involvement in compensating for loss of symbiont-derived nutrients.

Multiple classes of ncRNA have recently been identified as putative regulators of glucose metabolism, in which phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase plays a key role (e.g., Lai et al., 2020)

In the teleost fish *Paralichthys olivaceus*, Propionyl-CoA carboxylase alpha chain gene expression is putatively regulated via a network of miRNA and lncRNA that is differentially expressed based on fertility status (Mang et al. 2021)

---

### 26 & 27. **FUN_042950 – TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2 (TRAF2)**
* **Function**: E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor protein involved in TNF receptor signaling, activating NF-κB and MAPK pathways, crucial for inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis.
* **Energy Role**: Regulates cellular stress responses, which can influence mitochondrial function, cell metabolism, and energy balance, especially under inflammatory or oxidative stress.
([NCBI Gene: TRAF2][15])

In general, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) play a role in apoptosis, and are associated with immune response. TRAF2, specifically, suppresses apoptosis and necroptosis (Petersen et al. 2015) In humans, dysregulation of TNFs and TRAFs is implicated in several cancer types. TRAF2 has also been implicated as part of an immune regulation network that is modulated by both miRNA and lncRNA (Ebrahimi & Golestani 2021).

In *Acropora hyacinthus*, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 is downregulated in response to bleaching (Barshis et al., 2013).
