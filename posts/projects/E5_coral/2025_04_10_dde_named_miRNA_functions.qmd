We've determined putative function of our miRNAs by [running functional enrichment on each miRNA's putative targets](./2025_04_09_dde_miranda_miRNA_FE). Now I'd like to compare our putative functions to the function(s) of any miRNA that are previously described.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Read in miRNA with assigned names
miRNA_named <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/deep-dive-expression/77b55212aaca4763917f67188d9e5e0fd1000c11/D-Apul/output/11-Apul-sRNA-ShortStack_4.1.0-pulchra_genome/ShortStack_out/Apul_Results_mature_named_miRNAs.csv") %>% select(Name, given_miRNA_name)

print(miRNA_named %>% filter(!grepl("novel", given_miRNA_name)))
```

9 of our 39 miRNA identified by Shortstack are previously described.

```{r}
# Read in functional enrichment analysis results
miRNA_FE <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/deep-dive-expression/77b55212aaca4763917f67188d9e5e0fd1000c11/D-Apul/output/09.1-Apul-mRNA-miRNA-interactions-functional-enrichment/miRNA_targets_topGO_FE.csv")

# Function for pulling encriched terms for input miRNA
FE <- function(miRNA_name){
  cluster <- miRNA_named %>% filter(given_miRNA_name == miRNA_name) %>% pull(Name)
  terms <- miRNA_FE %>% filter(miRNA == cluster) %>% select(GO.ID, Term, type)
  
  print(terms)
}
```

```{r}
# Read in functional annotation table
miRNA_FA <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/deep-dive-expression/refs/heads/main/D-Apul/output/09.1-Apul-mRNA-miRNA-interactions-functional-enrichment/miRNA_targets_FA.csv")

# Filter to significant correlation of expression
miRNA_sig_FA <- miRNA_FA %>%
  filter(p_value < 0.05) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Gene.Ontology.IDs))

# Function to pull annotated terms for input miRNA
sig_FA <- function(miRNA_name){
  cluster <- miRNA_named %>% filter(given_miRNA_name == miRNA_name) %>% pull(Name)
  terms <- miRNA_sig_FA %>% filter(miRNA == cluster) %>% select(Gene.Ontology..biological.process., Gene.Ontology.IDs, mRNA)
  
  print(terms)
}
```

## mir-2022

Functions that are enriched in this miRNA's putative targets:

```{r}
FE("apul-mir-2022")
```

Functions of targets with significantly correlated expression:

```{r}
sig_FA("apul-mir-2022")
```

@teefy2020 found that predicted targets of miR-2022 are predominantly expressed in nematocytes and that miR-2022 is controlled by PAX-A transcription factor, a regulator of nematogenesis in cnidarians. They hypothesize that "miR-2022 participates in an incoherent feedforward loop to control gene dosage during nematocyte development."

@fridrich_ancient_2023 showed that miR-2022 is predominantly expressed in stinging cells, and that miR-2022 knockdown in *Nematostella* inhibits cnidogenisis (development of stinging cnidocyte cells) and defensive capabilities in juvenile *Nematostella*

@liew_identification_2014 found that predicted targets of miR-2022 in *Stylophera pistillata* are enriched (topGO, FDR pval \< 0.01) for the Biological Processes:

**Immunity:** "GO:0044003: modification by symbiont of host morphology or physiology", "GO:0019048: virus-host interaction"\
**Cell cycle:** "GO:0010564 : regulation of cell cycle process", "GO:0000281: cytokinesis after mitosis", "GO:2001237: negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway"**\
Transport/Signaling:** "GO:0042147: retrograde transport, endosome to Golgi", "GO:0006886: intracellular protein transport", "GO:0051904: pigment granule transport"\
**Differentiation/development:** "\*\*GO:0001822: kidney development", "GO:0030858: positive regulation of epithelial cell differentiation", "GO:0001942: hair follicle development", "GO:0048864: stem cell development", "GO:0021670: lateral ventricle development", "GO:0043588: skin development"

Our enriched terms seem to support the previously described function of miR-2022, since both "startle response" and "tachykinin receptor activity" are directly related to sensation/response, a primary function of nematocytes/cnidocytes!

## mir-2030

@liew_identification_2014 found that predicted targets of miR-2030 in *Stylophera pistillata* are enriched (topGO, FDR pval \< 0.01) for the Biological Processes:
