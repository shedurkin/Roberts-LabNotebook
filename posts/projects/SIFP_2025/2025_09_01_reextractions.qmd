After using most of my 1800s DNA in a partially unsuccessful library prep ([Group 3 Library 1](./2025_08_31_flongle_G3L1.qmd)), I want extra for additional preps. I need to extract more DNa for 5 specimens:

| Catalog \# | Collection Year |
|------------|-----------------|
| 50603      | 1912            |
| 19054      | 1898            |
| 42137      | 1897            |
| 14399      | 1886            |
| 50368      | 1880            |

Subsampled and began tissue digestion, as detailed [here](./2025_07_09_subampling_extractions.qmd).

Began digestion at 7:00pm, 09/01/2025, will run for \~48hr.

[**Notes:**]{.underline}

-   A power outage interrupted digestion incubation. Incubator stopped at \~9pm 09/02/25, and I restarted it \~7am 09/03/25, so digestions were sitting at room temp for \~10hrs.

-   Spiked in 20uL proteinase K to each tube, will let digestions sit on shaking incubator for another 12-24hr.
