After pulling the completed Flongle run of Group 1, Library 1, performed pore check on all remaining Flongle flow cells.

As a reminder, pore check of the flow cell used for Group 1 Library 1 showed:

| SN         | Flow Cell ID | Num. pores |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| B028104085 | AYW935       | 59         |

Checked all 11 remaining Flongle flow cells. As a reminder, \<50 pores would fall below warranty, and the maximum is 126pores.

| SN         | Flow Cell ID | Num. pores |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| B028104112 | AXS867       | **37**     |
| B028103996 | AXS408       | **40**     |
| B028103978 | AYL256       | **35**     |
| B028103949 | AYL126       | 80         |
| B028104129 | AYW871       | 61         |
| B028104068 | AYK267       | 59         |
| B028103992 | AYK963       | 89         |
| B028104122 | AYW685       | 59         |
| B028104029 | AYX067       | 79         |
| B028104142 | AYL029       | **44**     |
| B028104167 | AYL248       | 60         |

Wow, so 4/12 (or 1/3) of the Flongle flow cells we received are below warranty. Another 5, including the cell used for Group 1 Library 1, have pore counts *just* above the minimum.

I contacted Nanopore Support to request replacements for the out-of-warranty cells on 08/13/2025, case number 01333308. **Reorder number is RD060692.**
