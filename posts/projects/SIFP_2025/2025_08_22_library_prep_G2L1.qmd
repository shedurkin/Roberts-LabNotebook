Library prep for Group 2 using Native Barcoding 96 V14 Kit. This is the first attempt at library prep for this set of individuals (Library 1).

Again, I will be including 3 specimens in a single sequencing round. This will be 3 individuals from the "mid-age" specimens.

| Catalog \# | Year collected | Conc. (ng/uL) | uL for 1000ng | Barcode |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| 51861      | 1960           | 94.1          | 10.63         | 15      |
| 51892      | 1960           | 137           | 7.3           | 16      |
| 51732      | 1960           | 157           | 6.37          | 17      |

Performed prep as outlined in [ONT Native Barcoding 96 V14 protocol for gDNA](./protocols/ligation-sequencing-gdna-native-barcoding-v14-sqk-nbd114-24-document-checklist-MinION-en-NBE_9169_v114_revV_02Jul2025-39.pdf), with the following modifications:

-   Excluded DCS

-   Began with 1000ng input DNA from each sample

-   Retained 3.75uL end-prepped DNA through to barcode ligation for each sample
