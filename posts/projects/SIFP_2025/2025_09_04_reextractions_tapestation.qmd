Using Tapestation to evaluate size distribution, integrity of 1800s re-extractions. Will also run some old extractions to check whether they've degraded since first being extracted.

This time since I expect my 1800s samples to have essentially no HMW DNA, will use an **HS D5000 tape** instead of a gDNA tape.

HS D5000 tape requires 2uL of DNA sample. I want to conserve my extractions, and the HS D5000 tape can handle very low concentrations, so I'll be using a 2x dilution for all samples (1uL extraction + 1uL Zymo EB)

Followed HS D5000 protocol found [here](./protocols/Agilent_4200_D5000_QuickGuide.pdf).

**Tapestation layout:**

|     | 1           | 2       |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| A   | Ladder      | 1740363 |
| B   | 50368 (new) | 51892   |
| C   | 50603 (new) | 51732   |
| D   | 19054 (new) | 14399   |
| E   | 14399 (new) | 50368   |
| F   | 42137 (new) | 50603   |
| G   | 1606826     |         |
| H   | 1740336     |         |

Full tapestation report.

[**Notes:**]{.underline}

-   Looks like 50368 (new), 42137 (new), and 14399 (new) are by far the best 1800s re-extractions to use for sequencing.

-   Don't see an immediately obvious degradation issue comparing new to old extractions of 50368, 50603, 14399, will need to compare to OG tapestation.
