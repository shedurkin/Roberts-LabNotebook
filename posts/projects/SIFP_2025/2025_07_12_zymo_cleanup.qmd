### Zymo Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator - 10 Protocol

1.  Add **5 volumes of ChIP DNA Binding Buffer** to each volume of DNA sample. Mix thoroughly and spin down.

    e.g., to 100uL of sample DNA, add 500uL ChIP DNA Binding Buffer

2.  Transfer mixture to a Zymo Spin Column (IC-XC) in a collection tube.

3.  Centrifuge 30s at 12,000 RPM. Discard flow through.

4.  Add **200uL DNA Wash Buffer** to the column. Centrifuge 1 min at 12,000 RPM. Discard flow through.

5.  Repeat Step 4.

6.  Add **\>= 10 uL DNA Elution Buffer** (or nuclease-free water) directly to the column matrix and incubate at room temp for 1 minute. Transfer column to a labelled 1.5mL tube and centrifuge for \>=30 sec to elute DNA.

    To improve yield, one can heat DNA Elution Buffer to 60C before use.

Notes:

-   Aliquoted DNA Elution Buffer to 2mL tube and heated to 60C before use.

-   Eluted each sample in 50uL of buffer.

Performed Zymo Cleanup on both Round 1 and Round 2 extractions at 1:00pm, July 12, 2025. Stored cleaned DNA in fridge for the weekend.
