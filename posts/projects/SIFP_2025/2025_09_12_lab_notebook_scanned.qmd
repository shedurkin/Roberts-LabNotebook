Scanned my physical lab notebook and saved to pdf as part of this repo -- view it [here](./images/SIFP_2025_Lab_Notebook_Scanned.pdf).

My lab notebook will need to remain at the Smithsonian NMNH, where I conducted this research. To keep a copy for future reference, I've already been transcribing entries into this digital lab notebook. I also, however, want an exact copy, just in case I've made any transcription errors.
