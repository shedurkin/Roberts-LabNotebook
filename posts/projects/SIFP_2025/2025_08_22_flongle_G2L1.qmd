Ran Group 2 Library 1 on a Flongle flow cell to confirm successful library prep.

Performed hardware check on Flongle adapter. Then inserted flongle flow cell and performed flow cell check.

[**Flongle flow cell:**]{.underline}\
ID: AYW871\
61 pores on first pore check\
57 pores on this pore check

According to TapeStation peaks these samples are \~700bp in avg fragment length. Thus, the recommended Flongle loading amount of 5-10fmol is roughly equivalent to 2.16ng - 4.31ng.

I loaded the Flongle with 10fmol (4.31ng) of Group 2 Library 1 in 5uL of EB. G2L1 concentration is too high to accurately pipette 4.31ng, so instead mixed:

$$
\frac{4.3ng\ DNA}{5uL\ EB} = \frac{20ng\ DNA}{23.3uL\ EB}\ \ \ Added\ 1uL\ G2L1\ to\ (23.3-1)=22.3uL\ EB
$$
