Checked Group 2 Library 2 on a Flongle flow cell.

Flow cell:\
ID: AYX067\
79 pores on pore check

Based on TapeStation peaks, samples are \~700bp, so 10fmol = 4.31ng.

$$
\frac{4.31ng\ DNA}{5uL\ EB} = \frac{21.55ng\ DNA}{25uL\ EB}
$$

Then calculate volume of G2L2 needed

$$
\frac{21.55ng}{24.2 \frac{ng}{uL}} = 0.89uL\ input
$$

Can approximate requisite input to 1uL, so mixed 1uL G2L2 with 24uL EB (total 25uL).

Loaded Flongle with 5uL of this.
