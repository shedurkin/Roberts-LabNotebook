Two of my 1800s extractions that I want to include in Group 3 are below the concentration needed to get 1000ng in 11uL. I'm going to concentrate them to a lower volume/higher concentration, using the Zymo Genomic DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (full protocol [here](./2025_07_12_zymo_cleanup.qmd)).

| Catalog \# | Tube | Conc. (ng/uL) | vol. (uL) | desired conc. (ng/uL) | desired vol. (uL) |
|------------|------|---------------|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 50368      | C7   | 68.3          | 25        | 91                    | 18.76, \~19       |
| 42137      | B2   | 46.3          | 26        | 91                    | 13.23, \~14       |

desired concentration = 1000ng/11uL = 91ng/uL\
desired volume = (conc. + vol.)/desired conc.

Eluted each sample in the desired volume of Zymo EB (heated first to 60C)

Made a 5X dilution of each (1uL DNA + 4uL Zymo EB), then:

-   Quantified each with the Qubit (1X dsDNA HS protocol and kit)

    Standard 1: 34.04\
    Standard 2: 13568.74\
    50368: 7.4ng/uL --x5--\> 37ng/uL\
    42137: 5.39ng/ul --x5--\> 26.95ng/uL

-   QC'd with Epoch spectrophotometer

    |       | 260/280 | 260/230 |
    |-------|---------|---------|
    | 50368 | 1.917   | 2.369   |
    | 42137 | 1.9     | 3.018   |

Soooo Zymo did not concentrate my samples. I must have lost too mcuh during the clean. I actually cut concentration by a bit. I'll just have to work with what I got :(

I also may need to fully exclude 42137 due to the high 260/230, indicating possible chemical contamination.
