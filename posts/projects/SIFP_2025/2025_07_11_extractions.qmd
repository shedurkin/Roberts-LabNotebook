Completed *E. tourneforti* extractions

### Qiagen DNEasy Extraction Protocol (after digestion)

2.  Add **200uL Buffer AL**. Mix thoroughly by vortexing, and spin down the sides.
3.  Add **200ul 95% ethanol**. Mix thoroughly by vortexing, and spin down the sides.
4.  Pipet mixture onto a labelled DNEasy Mini Spin Column placed in a 2mL collection tube. Centrifuge \@ \>= 8,000 RPM for 1 min. Discard the flow through and collection tube.
5.  Place column in a new 2mL collection tube. Add **500uL Buffer AW1**. Centrifuge at \>= 8,000 RPM for 1 min. Discard the flow through and collection tube.
6.  Place column in a new 2mL collection tube. Add **500uL Buffer AW2**. Centrifuge at 14,000 RPM for 3 min. Discard the flow through and collection tube.
7.  Transfer the spin column to a new, labelled 1.5mL or 2mL tube.
8.  Elute the DNA by adding **50uL Buffer AE** to the center of the spin column membrane. Incubate at room temperature for 1 min. Centrifuge 1 min. at \>= 8,000 RPM.
9.  Repeat step 8, for a [final elution volume of 100uL]{.underline}.
