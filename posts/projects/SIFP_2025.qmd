::: {#description}
I'll be completing a project at the National Museum of Natual History as part of the Smithsonian Institution Fellowship Program (SIFP) during Summer 2025, under the advisorship of Dr. Andrea Quattrini!

I'll be benchmarking Nanopore direct sequencing as a method for mapping hDNA methylation in archival coral specimens.
