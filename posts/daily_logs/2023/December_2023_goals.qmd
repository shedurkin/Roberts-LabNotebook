## December Goals

(Note, I'll likely be out/less productive over the Christmas holiday)

## Reviewing November Goals

✓ Register, plan for, and present at GSS (will be on undergrad work, not Roberts lab stuff)

✓ Read 2 project-relevant papers a week (8 total)

✓ Cod project: Send samples out for RNA sequencing (don't need any sample prep, just find and send)

✓ Coral project: Identify short RNAs for *Porites evermanni* and *Pocillopora meandrina*
