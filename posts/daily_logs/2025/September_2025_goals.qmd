I'm writing this in the last few days of September, as the Fall 2025 quarter is starting. For the last \~1 week of September, my goals are as follows:

### SIFP

-   Finish transcribing all SIFP lab notebook entries into digital lab notebook

-   Finish all SIFP file transfers, including checksum generation once folders are unzipped

-   Add links to sequencing run reports to all sequencing lab notebook entries, once files are fully available on Gannet

-   Compile summary stats on all MinION sequencing runs (# bases, \# reads, avg. coverage, etc.)

-   Estimate contamination (e.g., fungal) in all MinION sequencing runs, using Kraken

### DDE

-   Figure out DDE figures -- what's the big takeaway(s) of the paper, and how can we best show that in \~3 figures.
