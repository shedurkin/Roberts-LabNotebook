Weekly overview:

This week I hit the hours/week goal nicely, but my allocation is a bit skewed. I'm spending more time on TAing and less time on thesis work than I'd like. While I'm still within the 20hr/wk slot allowable for my TA position, I'd like to bring the hours down to 15hr/wk to allow more time for my own research.
