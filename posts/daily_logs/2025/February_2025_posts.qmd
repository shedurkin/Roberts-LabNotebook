hours <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGCiQlMPibYPxe2w_sVP0_9L6kkd0rxkxO5Kq71IR6o/edit?gid=0#gid=0")

paste0("My daily average is ", round(avg_daily,1), " hours, with a weekly average of ", round(avg_weekly,1), " hours.")

# Plot weekly hours over time
weekly_totals <- hours %>%
  group_by(Week) %>%
  summarise(Total_Hours = sum(Totals))

ggplot(weekly_totals, aes(x = Week, y = Total_Hours, group = 1)) +

  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Total Hours per Week Over Time", x = "Week", y = "Total Hours") +
  ylim(0,55) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Plot hours by weekday for each week
ggplot(hours, aes(x = Weekday, y = Totals, group = Week, color = Week)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Daily Hours per Week", x = "Weekday", y = "Total Hours") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Stacked bars of average hours each weekday by category
hours_long <- hours %>%
  select(Weekday, Classes, TAing, `Thesis work`, Misc.) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Weekday, names_to = "Category", values_to = "Hours") %>%
  group_by(Weekday, Category) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Hours = mean(Hours)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(hours_long, aes(x = Weekday, y = Avg_Hours, fill = Category)) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

This is pretty interesting! My weekly hours have stayed pretty consistent over the last two months and, while daily hours vary by day and week, the average breakdown of my hours by day and category makes a lot of sense! My TAing work is heavily front-loaded at the beginning of the week, since I teach labs and host office hours Mon/Tues/Wed and have to finish grading by Wed. Classes remain pretty consistent throughout, with a peak on Thursday when FSH513 meets. My research hours increase over the week as TAing commitments drop off, peaking on Fridays when my day is almost completely clear of other commitments.

\* Federal holiday (Presidents' Day)

This was a good week! Despite the federal holiday I spent less time on classes than expected, hit my desired TAing hours exactly, and was able to spend a little extra time on research. Ideally I should have reduced my overall hours a bit more, since I would proportionally want 40 hrs in a 4-day work week.

## 20 February 2025

#### Thursday

-   **1.5 hr** -- SWED102

-   **1.5 hr** -- troubleshooting launching an Rstudio server through Klone -- got it to work! And was able to run correlation analyses, whcih is the whole reason I needed to use Klone. Yay!

-   **1 hr** -- weekly lab meeting. discussed Zach's lncRNA paper and Klone

-   **2 hr** -- FSH513 lit review on coral historical baselines ("prehuman" and pre-1980, when first mass bleaching event was recorded). Also, some reading on the concept of "shifting baselines," which will likely be relevant to final FISH513 manuscript

-   **0.5 hr** -- QSCI381 weekly meeting

-   **2 hr** -- FSH513 class

Daily total: **8.5 hr**

## 19 February 2025

#### Wednesday

-   **1.5 hr** -- SWED102 HW and weekly Quiz

-   **1.5 hr** -- SWED102 class

-   **1.5 hr** -- FSH513 finished digitizing data from GCRMN 2020 hard coral cover figure, read into R and plotted

-   **2 hrs** -- degree stuff. Looked over my Plan of Study again and realized that the Degree Audit tool is inaccurate -- I actually need \~12 additional credits of graded coursework, not the \~5 I thought I had left. I decided on FISH546 (Bioinformatics), CSE416 (Machine Learning), and FISH 544 (Conservation Genetics) to meet the credit requirement and sent my M.S. Plan of Study to committee members for signing.

-   **1 hr** -- Read lncRNA paper for Lab Meeting tomorrow (Deng et al., 2022, doi: 10.1007/s11160-022-09734-7, selected by Zach)

-   **2 hrs** -- QSCI381 Office Hours

-   **0.5 hr** -- FSH513 wrote up methods thus far. Will need to do more lit review before writing discussion, focusing on potential gaps in the GCRMN report (e.g. how much had reefs already declined by 1980, when this dataset starts?)

-   **1 hr** -- E5, read through some of my sources to double check that miRanda isn't making any mammal-specific sequence feature assumptions (other than the seed region) -- don't think it is. Read through current state of deep dive expression manuscript + comments/to-do.

-   **1.5 hr** -- trying to launch an RStudio instance through Klone again, still getting same issue as in January. Details in the [github issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/2066) and my [notebook post](../../projects/misc/2025_02_19_klone_rstudio.qmd)

Similar to last week, which I'm actually happy with since I was sick for one of the days this week! My TA hours were higher though, which is not the direction I want them to be moving. Some of this time was setup for the next few weeks, so hopefully that helps.

This week I hit the hours/week goal nicely, but my allocation is a bit skewed. I'm spending more time on TAing and less time on thesis work than I'd like. While I'm still within the 20hr/wk slot allowable for my TA position, I'd like to bring the hours down to 15hr/wk to allow more time for my own research.
