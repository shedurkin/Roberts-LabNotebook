See April Goals [here](./April_2025_goals.qmd)

**Progress:**

-   Completed [budget planning for SIFP](../../projects/SIFP_2025/2025_04_09_SIFP_planning.qmd), and [met with Andrea](../../projects/SIFP_2025/2025_04_10_Andrea_meeting.qmd) to discuss details of fellowship. Will be meeting again early May.

-   Completed several outstanding Github issues for `deep-dive-expression`. Note, however, that these will also need to be run with the miRanda outputs from searching 5UTR and CDS for targets.

    -   Functional annotation of gene-miRNA interaction network ([Github issue](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive-expression/issues/22), [notebook post](../../projects/E5_coral/2025_04_09_dde_miranda_miRNA_FE.qmd))

    -   Compare function composition of mRNA targets to full reference ([Github issue](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive-expression/issues/23), [notebook post](../../projects/E5_coral/2025_04_08_dde_miranda_FE.qmd))

    -   Compare / contrast mRNA target functions ([Github issue](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive-expression/issues/24), [notebook post](../../projects/E5_coral/2025_04_10_dde_named_miRNA_functions.qmd))

-   Performed several trial runs of Ariana's ML model with various inputs, see several notebook posts [here](../../projects/E5_coral.qmd)

-   Writing for Thesis Proposal

**To-Do:**

-   Keep Writing for Thesis Proposal

-   Update Deep Dive Expression draft

-   Incorporate lncRNA and methylation data into ML model

-   Lit review into ML model

-   EPIMAR presentation
