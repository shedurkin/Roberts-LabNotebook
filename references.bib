In this context, epigenetics—mechanisms that facilitate phenotypic variation through genotype–environment interactions—are of great interest ecologically and evolutionarily. Our comprehensive review of marine environmental epigenetics guides our recommendations of four key areas for future research: the dynamics of wash-in and wash-out of epigenetic effects, the mechanistic understanding of the interplay of different epigenetic marks and the interaction with the microbiome, the capacity for and mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, and the evolutionary implications of the interaction of genetic and epigenetic features. Emerging insights in marine environmental epigenetics can be applied to critical issues such as aquaculture, biomonitoring, and biological invasions, thereby improving our ability to explain and predict the responses of marine taxa to global climate change.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Organismal responses to stressful environments are influenced by numerous transcript- and protein-level mechanisms, and the relationships between expression changes at these levels are not always straightforward. Here, we used paired transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from two previous studies from gill of the California mussel, Mytilus californianus, to explore how simultaneous transcript and protein abundance patterns may diverge under different environmental scenarios. Field-acclimatized mussels were sampled from two disparate intertidal sites; individuals from one site were subjected to three further treatments (common garden, low-intertidal or high-intertidal outplant) that vary in temperature and feeding time. Assessing 1519 genes shared between the two datasets revealed that both transcript and protein expression patterns differentiated the treatments at a global level, despite numerous underlying discrepancies. There were far more instances of differential expression between treatments in transcript only (1451) or protein only (226) than of the two levels shifting expression concordantly (68 instances). Upregulated expression of cilium-associated transcripts (likely related to feeding) was associated with relatively benign field treatments. In the most stressful treatment, transcripts, but not proteins, for several molecular chaperones (including heat shock proteins and endoplasmic reticulum chaperones) were more abundant, consistent with a threshold model for induction of translation of constitutively available mRNAs. Overall, these results suggest that the relative importance of transcript- and protein-level regulation (translation and/or turnover) differs among cellular functions and across specific microhabitats or environmental contexts. Furthermore, the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression can vary across benign versus acutely stressful environmental conditions.},

The majority of studies about lncRNAs focus on model organisms, with lessened investigation in non-model organisms to date. Herein, we have undertaken an investigation on lncRNA in two zoanthids (cnidarian): Protolpalythoa varibilis and Palythoa caribaeorum. A total of 11,206 and 13,240 lncRNAs were detected in P. variabilis and P. caribaeorum transcriptome, respectively. Comparison using NONCODE database indicated that the majority of these lncRNAs is taxonomically species-restricted with no identifiable orthologs. Even so, we found cases in which short regions of P. caribaeorum’s lncRNAs were similar to vertebrate species’ lncRNAs, and could be associated with lncRNA conserved regulatory functions. Consequently, some high-confidence lncRNA-mRNA interactions were predicted based on such conserved regions, therefore revealing possible involvement of lncRNAs in posttranscriptional processing and regulation in anthozoans. Moreover, investigation of differentially expressed lncRNAs, in healthy colonies and colonial individuals undergoing natural bleaching, indicated that some up-regulated lncRNAs in P. caribaeorum could posttranscriptionally regulate the mRNAs encoding proteins of Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway and components of innate immune-system, which could contribute to the molecular response of coral bleaching.},

	abstract = {Reference is regularly made to the power of new genomic sequencing approaches. Using powerful technology, however, is not the same as having the necessary power to address a research question with statistical robustness. In the rush to adopt new and improved genomic research methods, limitations of technology and experimental design may be initially neglected. Here, we review these issues with regard to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA-seq adds large-scale transcriptomics to the toolkit of ecological and evolutionary biologists, enabling differential gene expression (DE) studies in nonmodel species without the need for prior genomic resources. High biological variance is typical of field-based gene expression studies and means that larger sample sizes are often needed to achieve the same degree of statistical power as clinical studies based on data from cell lines or inbred animal models. Sequencing costs have plummeted, yet RNA-seq studies still underutilize biological replication. Finite research budgets force a trade-off between sequencing effort and replication in RNA-seq experimental design. However, clear guidelines for negotiating this trade-off, while taking into account study-specific factors affecting power, are currently lacking. Study designs that prioritize sequencing depth over replication fail to capitalize on the power of RNA-seq technology for DE inference. Significant recent research effort has gone into developing statistical frameworks and software tools for power analysis and sample size calculation in the context of RNA-seq DE analysis. We synthesize progress in this area and derive an accessible rule-of-thumb guide for designing powerful RNA-seq experiments relevant in eco-evolutionary and clinical settings alike.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are diverse ecosystems of great ecological and economic importance. However, corals are vulnerable to a variety of stressors, including rising seawater temperatures, and yet little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying their survival and adaptation to stress. Like other animals, corals possess genes for key members of the microRNA (miRNA) machinery. miRNAs are short RNAs that regulate diverse cellular processes, including organismal stress response, through post-transcriptional repression of gene transcripts. Through small RNA sequencing, we identified 26 miRNAs in the coral, Acropora digitifera. Many of the identified miRNAs are novel, while eight are conserved with miRNAs previously identified in other cnidarians. One of the identified miRNAs is differentially expressed in coral tissues exposed to acute thermal stress. This thermally responsive miRNA putatively regulates multiple pathways of the organismal stress response, DNA/RNA expression regulation, repair mechanisms, tissue morphogenesis, and signalling. We propose a model by which miRNA regulation allows the coral to mount a robust stress response through sequestration of a pool of nontranslated transcripts encoding stress response proteins. Release of miRNA-mediated repression under stress conditions may result in rapid and abundant translation of proteins that help the coral maintain cellular homoeostasis. These findings highlight the potential importance of miRNAs in the thermal resilience of corals.},

	doi = {10.1101/gr.162503.113},
	abstract = {In bilaterians, which comprise most of extant animals, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the majority of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) via base-pairing of a short sequence (the miRNA "seed") to the target, subsequently promoting translational inhibition and transcript instability. In plants, many miRNAs guide endonucleolytic cleavage of highly complementary targets. Because little is known about miRNA function in nonbilaterian animals, we investigated the repertoire and biological activity of miRNAs in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a representative of Cnidaria, the sister phylum of Bilateria. Our work uncovers scores of novel miRNAs in Nematostella, increasing the total miRNA gene count to 87. Yet only a handful are conserved in corals and hydras, suggesting that microRNA gene turnover in Cnidaria greatly exceeds that of other metazoan groups. We further show that Nematostella miRNAs frequently direct the cleavage of their mRNA targets via nearly perfect complementarity. This mode of action resembles that of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and plant miRNAs. It appears to be common in Cnidaria, as several of the miRNA target sites are conserved among distantly related anemone species, and we also detected miRNA-directed cleavage in Hydra. Unlike in bilaterians, Nematostella miRNAs are commonly coexpressed with their target transcripts. In light of these findings, we propose that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs functions differently in Cnidaria and Bilateria. The similar, siRNA-like mode of action of miRNAs in Cnidaria and plants suggests that this may be an ancestral state.},

However, they are in rapid decline due to global environmental changes such as rising sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, and pollution. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses have broadened our understanding of coral biology, but a study of the microRNA (miRNA) repertoire of corals is missing. miRNAs constitute a class of small non-coding RNAs of ∼22 nt in size that play crucial roles in development, metabolism, and stress response in plants and animals alike. In this study, we examined the coral Stylophora pistillata for the presence of miRNAs and the corresponding core protein machinery required for their processing and function. Based on small RNA sequencing, we present evidence for 31 bona fide microRNAs, 5 of which (miR-100, miR-2022, miR-2023, miR-2030, and miR-2036) are conserved in other metazoans. Homologues of Argonaute, Piwi, Dicer, Drosha, Pasha, and HEN1 were identified in the transcriptome of S. pistillata based on strong sequence conservation with known RNAi proteins, with additional support derived from phylogenetic trees. Examination of putative miRNA gene targets indicates potential roles in development, metabolism, immunity, and biomineralisation for several of the microRNAs. Here, we present first evidence of a functional RNAi machinery and five conserved miRNAs in S. pistillata, implying that miRNAs play a role in organismal biology of scleractinian corals. Analysis of predicted miRNA target genes in S. pistillata suggests potential roles of miRNAs in symbiosis and coral calcification. Given the importance of miRNAs in regulating gene expression in other metazoans, further expression analyses of small non-coding RNAs in transcriptional studies of corals should be informative about miRNA-affected processes and pathways.},

In this article, we review the results of recent experiments that show that transcription of non-protein-coding RNA is far more widespread than was previously anticipated. Although some ncRNAs act as molecular switches that regulate gene expression, the function of many ncRNAs is unknown. New experimental and computational approaches are emerging that will help determine whether these newly identified transcription products are evidence of important new biochemical pathways or are merely ‘junk’ RNA generated by the cell as a by-product of its functional activities.},

	abstract = {Environmental epigenetics has become a key research focus in global climate change studies and environmental pollutant investigations impacting aquatic ecosystems. Specifically, triggered by environmental stress conditions, intergenerational DNA methylation changes contribute to biological adaptive responses and survival of organisms to increase their tolerance towards these conditions. To critically review epigenetic analytical approaches in ecotoxicological aquatic research, we evaluated 78 publications reported over the past five years (2016–2021) that applied these methods to investigate the responses of aquatic organisms to environmental changes and pollution. The results show that DNA methylation appears to be the most robust epigenetic regulatory mark studied in aquatic animals. As such, multiple DNA methylation analysis methods have been developed in aquatic organisms, including enzyme restriction digestion-based and methyl-specific immunoprecipitation methods, and bisulfite (in)dependent sequencing strategies. In contrast, only a handful of aquatic studies, i.e. about 15\%, have been focusing on histone variants and post-translational modifications due to the lack of species-specific affinity based immunological reagents, such as specific antibodies for chromatin immunoprecipitation applications. Similarly, ncRNA regulation remains as the least popular method used in the field of environmental epigenetics. Insights into the opportunities and challenges of the DNA methylation and histone variant analysis methods as well as decreasing costs of next generation sequencing approaches suggest that large-scale epigenetic environmental studies in model and non-model organisms will soon become available in the near future. Moreover, antibody-dependent and independent methods, such as mass spectrometry-based methods, can be used as an alternative epigenetic approach to characterize global changes of chromatin histone modifications in future aquatic research. Finally, a systematic guide for DNA methylation and histone variant methods is offered for ecotoxicological aquatic researchers to select the most relevant epigenetic analytical approach in their research.},

To investigate the role of DNA methylation in environmental acclimatization, we generated a reference genome and surveyed the physiology and DNA methylomes of juvenile geoduck clams, Panopea generosa, under differing seawater pH regimes. Juveniles were initially exposed to one of three seawater pH conditions, followed by ambient common-garden conditions, then a second reciprocal exposure to ambient pH or pH 7.4. Within 10 days of the initial low pH exposure, juvenile clams showed decreased shell size relative to ambient pH with corresponding differential DNA methylation. Following four months of ambient common-garden conditions, juveniles initially exposed to low pH compensatorily grew larger, with DNA methylation indicative of these phenotypic differences, demonstrating epigenetic carryover effects persisted months after initial exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes revealed regulation of signal transduction through widespread changes in the Wnt signaling pathways that influence cell growth, proliferation, tissue and skeletal formation, and cytoskeletal change. After 10 days of secondary exposure to pH 7.4, naive juvenile clams were more sensitive to low pH compared to those initially exposed, showing reduced growth and having nearly a 2-fold greater change in DNA methylation. Collectively, this new genomic resource and coordinated phenotypic and methylomic response support that epigenetic mechanisms underlie acclimatization to provide beneficial phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Projecting ecological and evolutionary responses to variable and changing environments is central to anticipating and managing impacts to biodiversity and ecosystems. Current modeling approaches are largely phenomenological and often fail to accurately project responses due to numerous biological processes at multiple levels of biological organization responding to environmental variation at varied spatial and temporal scales. Limited mechanistic understanding of organismal responses to environmental variability and extremes also restricts predictive capacity. We outline a strategy for identifying and modeling the key organismal mechanisms across levels of biological organization that mediate ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental variation. A central component of this strategy is quantifying timescales and magnitudes of climatic variability and how organisms experience them. We highlight recent empirical research that builds this information and suggest how to design future experiments that can produce more generalizable principles. We discuss how to create biologically informed projections in a feasible way by combining statistical and mechanistic approaches. Predictions will inform both fundamental and practical questions at the interface of ecology, evolution, and Earth science such as how organisms experience, adapt to, and respond to environmental variation at multiple hierarchical spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Populations of marine species that respond differently to ocean acidification offer natural reservoirs of biodiversity that can be leveraged for conservation efforts and to sustain marine food systems. The molecular and physiological traits associated with tolerance to acidification must first be identified. This study leveraged oysters from three phenotypically distinct populations of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, but that were bred and reared in common conditions for four years. We assessed their growth, reproductive development, and transcriptional response to acidification within and across generations. Responses reveal energetic trade-offs that reflect unique physiotypes previously observed among populations. The population with the slowest growth but high survival rates, oysters from Dabob Bay, mounted the largest transcriptional response to acidification without effects to growth and reproduction. A moderate response was observed in the population with fastest growth rate but lowest fecundity (Fidalgo Bay). Oyster Bay, the population with highest fecundity but lowest survival rates, did not respond at the transcript level. Oyster Bay was also the only population for which acidification negatively affected growth and reproductive development. While exposure to acidification did not affect gene expression in the next generation’s larval stage, it did result in larger larvae in the Oyster Bay population, which could partially alleviate negative effects of acidification in the wild for that population. Given the distinct transcriptional response of the Dabob Bay population to acidification and its high survival rates in previous studies, we then identified genes that were uniquely expressed in Dabob Bay oysters compared to the other populations. Genes involved in antibacterial and antiviral processes, metabolism, growth, and reproduction were uniquely expressed in Dabob Bay, and many similar functions were identified in both adults and larvae, which provides insight into the mechanisms behind a stress-tolerant oyster population. The population-specific physiotypes and responses to acidification illustrate the diversity of physiological strategies in O. lurida that balance the energetic demands of growth, reproduction, cellular maintenance, and offspring viability. Taken together this study reveals that there are distinct physiotypes among marine invertebrate populations on small geographic scales with implications for species resilience to acidification and other environmental stressors.},

To test the role of life-stage and stress-intensity dependence in eliciting enhanced tolerance under subsequent stress encounters, we initially conditioned pediveliger Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) larvae to ambient and moderately elevated PCO2 (920 µatm and 2800 µatm, respectively) for 110 days. Then, clams were exposed to ambient, moderate or severely elevated PCO2 (750, 2800 or 4900 µatm, respectively) for 7 days and, following 7 days in ambient conditions, a 7-day third exposure to ambient (970 µatm) or moderate PCO2 (3000 µatm). Initial conditioning to moderate PCO2 stress followed by second and third exposure to severe and moderate PCO2 stress increased respiration rate, organic biomass and shell size, suggesting a stress-intensity-dependent effect on energetics. Additionally, stress-acclimated clams had lower antioxidant capacity compared with clams under ambient conditions, supporting the hypothesis that stress over postlarval-to-juvenile development affects oxidative status later in life. Time series and stress intensity-specific approaches can reveal life-stages and magnitudes of exposure, respectively, that may elicit beneficial phenotypic variation.},

Tissue-specificity has implications for gonad tissue, as gonad-specific methylation patterns may be inherited by offspring. We used the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) — a model for understanding pH impacts on bivalve molecular physiology due to its genomic resources and importance in global aquaculture— to assess how low pH could impact the gonad methylome. Oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 ± 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 ± 0.02) conditions for 7 weeks. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify methylated regions in female oyster gonad samples.

	abstract = {For marine invertebrates with a pelagic–benthic life cycle, larval exposure to ocean acidification (OA) can affect adult performance in response to another environmental stressor. This carry-over effect has the potential to alter phenotypic traits. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate “OA”-triggered carry-over effects have not been explored despite such information being key to improving species fitness and management strategies for aquafarming. This study integrated the genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome to examine epigenetic modification-mediated carry-over OA impacts on phenotypic traits of the ecologically and commercially important oyster species Crassostrea hongkongensis under field conditions. Larvae of C. hongkongensis were exposed to control pH 8.0 and low pH 7.4 conditions, mimicking near future OA scenario in their habitat, before being outplanted as post-metamorphic juveniles at two mariculture field sites with contrasting environmental stressors for 9 months. The larval carry-over OA effect was found to have persistent impacts on the growth and survival trade-off traits on the outplanted juveniles, although the beneficial or adverse effect depended on the environmental conditions at the outplanted sites. Site-specific plasticity was demonstrated with a diverse DNA methylation-associated gene expression profile, with signal transduction and the endocrine system being the most common and highly enriched functions. Highly methylated exons prevailed in the key genes related to general metabolic and endocytic responses and these genes are evolutionarily conserved in various marine invertebrates in response to OA. These results suggest that oysters with prior larval exposure history to OA had the ability to trigger rapid local adaptive responses via epigenetic modification to cope with multiple stressors in the field.},

	abstract = {Animals rely on genomic regulatory systems to direct the dynamic spatiotemporal and cell-type speciﬁc gene expression that is essential for the development and maintenance of a multicellular lifestyle. Although it is widely appreciated that these systems ultimately evolved from genomic regulatory mechanisms present in single-celled stem metazoans, it remains unclear how this occurred. Here, we focus on the contribution of the non-coding portion of the genome to the evolution of animal gene regulation, speciﬁcally on recent insights from non-bilaterian metazoan lineages, and unicellular and colonial holozoan sister taxa. High-throughput next-generation sequencing, largely in bilaterian model species, has led to the discovery of tens of thousands of non-coding RNA genes (ncRNAs), including short, long and circular forms, and uncovered the central roles they play in development. Based on the analysis of non-bilaterian metazoan, unicellular holozoan and fungal genomes, the evolution of some ncRNAs, such as Piwi-interacting RNAs, correlates with the emergence of metazoan multicellularity, while others, including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, appear to be more ancient. Analysis of non-coding regulatory DNA and histone post-translational modiﬁcations have revealed that some cis-regulatory mechanisms, such as those associated with proximal promoters, are present in non-animal holozoans, while others appear to be metazoan innovations, most notably distal enhancers. In contrast, the cohesin-CTCF system for regulating higher-order chromatin structure and enhancerpromoter long-range interactions appears to be restricted to bilaterians. Taken together, most bilaterian noncoding regulatory mechanisms appear to have originated before the divergence of crown metazoans. However, diﬀerential expansion of non-coding RNA and cis-regulatory DNA repertoires in bilaterians may account for their increased regulatory and morphological complexity relative to non-bilaterians.},

	abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators that activate silencing mechanisms by annealing to mRNA transcripts. While plant miRNAs match their targets with nearly-full complementarity leading to mRNA cleavage, miRNAs in most animals require only a short sequence called ‘seed’ to inhibit target translation. Recent findings showed that miRNAs in cnidarians, early-branching metazoans, act similarly to plant miRNAs, by exhibiting full complementarity and target cleavage; however, it remained unknown if seed- based regulation was possible in cnidarians. Here, we investigate the miRNA-target complementarity requirements for miRNA activity in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. We show that bilaterian-like complementarity of seed-only or seed and supplementary 3’ matches are insufficient for miRNA-mediated knockdown. Furthermore, miRNA-target mismatches in the cleavage site decrease knockdown efficiency. Finally, miRNA silencing of a target with three seed binding sites in the 3’ untranslated region that mimics typical miRNA targeting was repressed in zebrafish but not in Nematostella and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Altogether, these results unravel striking similarities between plant and cnidarian miRNAs consolidating the evidence for common evolutionary origin of miRNAs in plants and animals.},

RNA-Seq uses NGS to reveal RNA identities and quantities in a given sample. However, it produces a huge amount of raw data that need to be preprocessed with fast and effective computational methods. RNA-Seq can look at different populations of RNAs, including ncRNAs. Indeed, in the last few years, several ncRNAs pipelines have been developed for ncRNAs analysis from RNA-Seq experiments. In this paper, we analyze eight recent pipelines (iSmaRT, iSRAP, miARma-Seq, Oasis 2, SPORTS1.0, sRNAnalyzer, sRNApipe, sRNA workbench) which allows the analysis not only of single specific classes of ncRNAs but also of more than one ncRNA classes. Our systematic performance evaluation aims at guiding users to select the appropriate pipeline for processing each ncRNA class, focusing on three key points: (i) accuracy in ncRNAs identification, (ii) accuracy in read count estimation and (iii) deployment and ease of use.},

With 90\% of the human genome being transcribed and novel classes of ncRNA emerging (tRNA-derived small RNAs and circular RNAs among others), the great majority of the human transcriptome suggests that many important ncRNA functions/processes are yet to be discovered. An approach to filling such vast void of knowledge has been recently provided by the increasing application of next-generation sequencing (NGS), offering the unprecedented opportunity to obtain a more accurate profiling with higher resolution, increased throughput, sequencing depth, and low experimental complexity, concurrently posing an increasing challenge in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and usability of data analysis software. This review provides an overview of ncRNAs, NGS technology, and the most recent/popular computational approaches and the challenges they attempt to solve, which are essential to a more sensitive and comprehensive ncRNA annotation capable of furthering our understanding of this still vastly uncharted genomic territory.},

While studies have shown that ncRNAs are extremely diverse and ubiquitous, the functions of the vast majority of ncRNAs are still unknown. With ever-increasing ncRNAs under study, it is essential to identify, categorize and annotate these ncRNAs on a genome-wide scale. The use of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies provides a broader picture of the non-coding component of transcriptome, enabling the comprehensive identification and annotation of all major ncRNAs across samples. However, the detection of known and emerging class of ncRNAs from RNA-seq data demands complex computational methods owing to their unique as well as similar characteristics. Here, we discuss major plant endogenous, regulatory ncRNAs in an RNA sample followed by computational strategies applied to discover each class of ncRNAs using RNA-seq. We also provide a collection of relevant software packages and databases to present a comprehensive bioinformatics toolbox for plant ncRNA researchers. We assume that the discussions in this review will provide a rationale for the discovery of all major categories of plant ncRNAs.},

Coral-associated bacteria affect holobiont health via nutrient cycling, metabolic exchanges and pathogen exclusion, yet it is not fully understood how bacterial community shifts affect holobiont health and physiology. In this study, a combination of antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin and ciprofloxacin) was used to disrupt the bacterial communities of 14 colonies of the reef framework-building corals Pocillopora meandrina and P. verrucosa, originally collected from Panama and hosting diverse algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae). Symbiodiniaceae photochemical efficiencies and holobiont oxygen consumption (as proxies for coral health) were measured throughout a 5-day exposure. Antibiotics altered bacterial community composition and reduced alpha and beta diversity, however, several bacteria persisted, leading to the hypothesis that these bacteria are either antibiotics resistant or occupy internal niches that are shielded from antibiotics. While antibiotics did not affect Symbiodiniaceae photochemical efficiency, antibiotics-treated corals had lower oxygen consumption rates. RNAseq revealed that antibiotics increased expression of Pocillopora immunity and stress response genes at the expense of cellular maintenance and metabolism functions. Together, these results reveal that antibiotic disruption of corals' native bacteria negatively impacts holobiont health by decreasing oxygen consumption and activating host immunity without directly impairing Symbiodiniaceae photosynthesis, underscoring the critical role of coral-associated bacteria in holobiont health. They also provide a baseline for future experiments that manipulate Pocillopora corals' symbioses by first reducing the diversity and complexity of coral-associated bacteria.},

	abstract = {Modern-day Indo-Pacific coral reefs are characterized by rapid recovery driven by pulses of coral recruitment, but Caribbean reefs exhibit low rates of recruitment and poor recovery following a wide range of disturbance events. The contrasting evolutionary history of coral taxa offers key insight into biogeographic patterns of coral resilience. Following the closure of the Isthmus of Panama approximately 2.8 million years ago, widespread extinction of Caribbean corals led to an evolutionary bottleneck that favored large and long-lived species with a relatively high reliance on asexual versus sexual reproduction. In contrast, adaptive radiation led to the evolution of superrecruiting tabular, digitate, and corymbose corals that drive the rapid recovery of modern-day Indo-Pacific reefs following disturbance. The dominance of branching growth forms and evolutionary absence of superrecruiting growth forms throughout the entire evolutionary history of the Caribbean (approximately 38 million years ago to present) may explain the exceptionally high recruitment rates on modern-day Indo-Pacific reefs and low historical recruitment on Caribbean reefs. The evolutionary history of the Caribbean coral reef-building taxa implies that, even with a reversal of ecosystem state, widespread recovery of Caribbean reefs may be limited.},

Suspended sediments reduced survivorship of A. millepora strongly, proportional to the sediment concentration, but not in A. tenuis or P. acuta juveniles. However, juvenile growth of the latter two species was reduced to less than half or to zero, respectively. Additionally, suspended sediments increased effective quantum yields of symbionts associated with A. millepora and A. tenuis, but not those associated with P. acuta. Nutrient enrichment did not significantly affect juvenile survivorship, growth or photophysiology for any of the three species, either as a sole stressor or in combination with suspended sediments.

By integrating messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data with microRNA (miRNA) (i.e. small non-coding RNA with well-established regulatory roles in a myriad of biological processes) expression data, we show how integrative genomics approaches can be used to characterize the role played by approximately a third of registered mouse miRNAs within the context of a liver gene regulatory network. Our analysis reveals that the transcript abundances of miRNAs are subject to regulatory control by many more loci than previously observed for mRNA expression. Moreover, our results indicate that miRNAs exist as highly connected hub-nodes and function as key sensors within the transcriptional network. We also provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that miRNAs can act cooperatively or redundantly to regulate a given pathway and that miRNAs play a subtle role by dampening expression of their target gene through the use of feedback loops.},

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to discover and quantify diverse kinds of sncRNA, such as tRFs (tRNA-derived small RNA fragments), phasiRNAs (phased, secondary, small-interfering RNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs) and plant-specific 24-nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, currently available web-based tools do not provide approaches to comprehensively analyze all of these diverse sncRNAs. This study presents a novel integrated platform, sRNAtools (https://bioinformatics.caf.ac.cn/sRNAtools), that can be used in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing to identify and functionally annotate sncRNAs, including profiling microRNAss, piRNAs, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and rRNAs and discovering isomiRs, tRFs, phasiRNAs and plant-specific 24-nt siRNAs for up to 21 model organisms. Different modules, including single case, batch case, group case and target case, are developed to provide users with flexible ways of studying sncRNA. In addition, sRNAtools supports different ways of uploading small RNA sequencing data in a very interactive queue system, while local versions based on the program package/Docker/virtureBox are also available. We believe that sRNAtools will greatly benefit the scientific community as an integrated tool for studying sncRNAs.},

In this study, we compared the genomic and physiological response of diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) to conditions present during an atmospheric heatwave that impacted the Pacific Northwestern region of the United States in the summer of 2021. Climate stressors were applied either singly (single stressor; elevated seawater temperature, 30°C) or in succession (multiple stressor; elevated seawater temperature followed by aerial emersion at 44°C), replicating conditions present within the intertidal over a tidal cycle during the event. Oyster mortality rate was elevated within stress treatments with respect to the control and was significantly higher in triploids than diploids following multiple stress exposure (36.4\% vs. 14.8\%). Triploids within the multiple stressor treatment exhibited signs of energetic limitation, including metabolic depression, a significant reduction in ctenidium Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and the dysregulated expression of genes associated with stress response, innate immunity, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Functional enrichment analysis of ploidy-specific gene sets identified that biological processes associated with metabolism, stress tolerance, and immune function were overrepresented within triploids across stress treatments. Our results suggest that triploidy impacts the transcriptional regulation of key processes that underly the stress response of Pacific oysters, resulting in downstream shifts in physiological tolerance limits that may increase susceptibility to extreme climate events that present multiple environmental stressors. The impact of chromosome set manipulation on the climate resilience of marine organisms has important implications for domestic food security within future climate scenarios, especially as triploidy induction becomes an increasingly popular tool to elicit reproductive control across a wide range of species used within marine aquaculture.},

In addition to providing the first characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the oyster genus Ostrea, we identified 3,963 differentially methylated loci between populations. Our results show a clear coupling between genetic and epigenetic patterns of variation, with 27\% of variation in interindividual methylation differences explained by genotype. Underlying this association are both direct genetic changes in CpGs (CpG-SNPs) and genetic variation with indirect influence on methylation (mQTLs).

Computational identification of novel nmRNAs in genomes of model organisms is severely restricted owing to their lack of an open reading frame.

Two different procedures are introduced for cDNA library construction. First, we describe the construction of a general purpose cDNA library from sized RNA fractions. Second, we introduce a more specialized RNomics strategy employing this approach to generate a cDNA library from a specific abundant class of nmRNAs. This is illustrated using as a paradigm the two families of small nucleolar RNAs that guide modification of nucleotides in rRNAs or spliceosomal RNAs small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) by short antisense elements complementary to the modification site. Following the identification of novel members from the class of small nuclear RNAs by experimental RNomics, we demonstrate how their target sequences in rRNAs or snRNAs can be identified.},

	abstract = {The central dogma of biology holds that genetic information normally flows from DNA to RNA to protein. As a consequence it has been generally assumed that genes generally code for proteins, and that proteins fulfil not only most structural and catalytic but also most regulatory functions, in all cells, from microbes to mammals. However, the latter may not be the case in complex organisms. A number of startling observations about the extent of non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcription in the higher eukaryotes and the range of genetic and epigenetic phenomena that are RNA-directed suggests that the traditional view of the structure of genetic regulatory systems in animals and plants may be incorrect. ncRNA dominates the genomic output of the higher organisms and has been shown to control chromosome architecture, mRNA turnover and the developmental timing of protein expression, and may also regulate transcription and alternative splicing. This paper re-examines the available evidence and suggests a new framework for considering and understanding the genomic programming of biological complexity, autopoietic development and phenotypic variation.

Recent studies on cross-species transfer have provided breakthrough insights, but little is known about the interaction mechanisms of the inter-plant mobile substances in parasitic systems. We sequenced the transcriptomes of dodder growing on soybean hosts to characterize the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transfer between the two species, and found that lncRNAs can move in high numbers (365 dodder lncRNAs and 14 soybean lncRNAs) in a bidirectional manner. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction further confirmed that individual lncRNAs were trafficked in the dodder–soybean parasitic system. To reveal the potential functions of mobile transcripts, the Gene Ontology terms of mobile lncRNA target genes were predicted, and mobile dodder target genes were found to be mainly enriched in “metabolic process”, “catalytic activity”, “signaling”, and “response to stimulus” categories, whereas mobile soybean target genes were enriched in organelle-related categories, indicating that specific mobile lncRNAs may be important in regulating dodder parasitism. Our findings reveal that lncRNAs are transferred between dodder and its host soybean plants, which may act as critical regulators to coordinate the host–dodder interaction at the whole parasitic level.},

At the same time, a small number of well-studied lncRNAs have given us important clues about the biology of these molecules, and a few key functional and mechanistic themes have begun to emerge, although the robustness of these models and classification schemes remains to be seen. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the lncRNA field, discussing what is known about the genomic contexts, biological functions, and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs.

	abstract = {Epigenetic variation is often characterized by modifications to DNA that do not alter the underlying nucleotide sequence, but can influence behavior, morphology, and physiological phenotypes by affecting gene expression and protein synthesis. In this review, we consider how the emerging field of ecological epigenetics (eco-epi) aims to use epigenetic variation to explain ecologically relevant phenotypic variation and predict evolutionary trajectories that are important in conservation. Here, we focus on how epigenetic data have contributed to our understanding of wild populations, including plants, animals, and fungi. First, we identified published eco-epi literature and found that there was limited taxonomic and ecosystem coverage and that, by necessity of available technology, these studies have most often focused on the summarized epigenome rather than locus- or nucleotide-level epigenome characteristics. We also found that while many studies focused on adaptation and heritability of the epigenome, the field has thematically expanded into topics such as disease ecology and epigenome-based ageing of individuals. In the second part of our synthesis, we discuss key insights that have emerged from the epigenetic field broadly and use these to preview the path toward integration of epigenetics into ecology. Specifically, we suggest moving focus to nucleotide-level differences in the epigenome rather than whole-epigenome data and that we incorporate several facets of epigenome characterization (e.g., methylation, chromatin structure). Finally, we also suggest that incorporation of behavior and stress data will be critical to the process of fully integrating eco-epi data into ecology, conservation, and evolutionary biology.},

This study identified and evaluated the gene expression of lncRNAs in the gill and mantle tissues of Mytilus chilensis individuals from two ecologically different sites: Cochamó (41°S) and Yaldad (43°S), southern Chile, both impacted by climatic-related conditions and by mussel farming given their use as seedbeds. Sequences identified as lncRNAs exhibited tissue-specific differences, mapping to 3.54 \% of the gill transcriptome and 1.96 \% of the mantle transcriptome, representing an average of 2.76 \% of the whole transcriptome. Using a high fold change value (≥{\textbar}100{\textbar}), we identified 43 and 47 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) in the gill and mantle tissue of individuals sampled from Cochamó and 21 and 17 in the gill and mantle tissue of individuals sampled from Yaldad. Location-specific DE-lncRNAs were also detected in Cochamó (65) and Yaldad (94) samples. Via analysis of the differential expression of neighboring protein-coding genes, we identified enriched GO terms related to metabolic, genetic, and environmental information processing and immune system functions, reflecting how the impact of local ecological conditions may influence the M. chilensis (epi)genome expression. These DE-lncRNAs represent complementary biomarkers to DNA sequence variation for maintaining adaptive differences and phenotypic plasticity to cope with natural and human-driven perturbations., •Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs in the M. chilensisgenome represent approximately 2.76\% of its transcriptome.•Expression patterns of these DE-lncRNAs differentiate mussels from two ecologically distinct natural seedbeds.•DE-lncRNAs linked with neighboring genes impact diverse biological processes and potentially influence fitness traits..•Monitoring and conserving M. chilensis seedbeds can be facilitated by integrating variation in epigenetic factor expression.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is defined as a property of individual genotypes to produce different phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions. This ability may be expressed at behavioral, biochemical, physiological, and/or developmental levels, exerting direct influence over species' demographic performance. In reef-building corals, a group critically threatened by global change in the Anthropocene, non-genetic mechanisms (i.e., epigenetic and microbiome variation) have been shown to participate in plastic physiological responses to environmental change. Yet, the precise way in which these mechanisms interact, contribute to such responses, and their adaptive potential is still obscure. The present work aims to fill this gap by using a multi-omics approach to elucidate the contribution and interconnection of the mechanisms modulating phenotypic plasticity in staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) clones subject to different depth conditions. Results show changes in lipidome, epigenome and transcriptome, but not in symbiotic and microbial communities. In addition, a potential shift toward a more heterotrophic feeding behavior was evidenced in corals at the deeper site. These observations are consistent with a multi-mechanism modulation of rapid acclimation in corals, underscoring the complexity of this process and the importance of a multifactorial approach to inform potential intervention to enhance coral adaptive capacity.},

Inheritance of DNA methylation patterns provides a potential pathway for environmentally induced phenotypes to contribute to evolution of species and populations1–5. However, in basal metazoans, it is unknown whether inheritance of CpG methylation patterns occurs across the genome (as in plants) or as rare exceptions (as in mammals)4. Here, we show that DNA methylation patterns in a reef-building coral are determined by genotype and developmental stage, as well as by parental environment. Transmission of CpG methylation from adults to their sperm and larvae demonstrates genome-wide inheritance. Variation in the hypermethylation of genes in adults and their sperm from distinct environments suggests intergenerational acclimatization to local temperature and salinity. Furthermore, genotype-independent adjustments of methylation levels in stress-related genes were strongly correlated with offspring survival rates under heat stress. These findings support a role of DNA methylation in the intergenerational inheritance of traits in corals, which could extend to enhancing their capacity to adapt to climate change.},

We contend that stock reproductive potential was reduced during this period, evidenced by a combination of new laboratory data demonstrating narrow thermal hatch success (3–6 °C), mechanistic-based models of spawning habitat, and correlations with prerecruit time series. With the exception of single-year El Niño events (1998, 2003), the recent 3-year heatwave (2014–2016) and return to similar conditions in 2019 were potentially the most negative impacts on spawning habitat for Pacific cod in the available time series (1994–2019). Continued warming will likely reduce the duration and spatial extent of Pacific cod spawning in the Gulf of Alaska.},

	abstract = {Effects of various combinations of levels of salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen on incubation of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) eggs were investigated in the laboratory. Quantitative relations were determined, by response surface analysis, between the environmental variables and four criteria used to estimate success of egg development. Larval size at mean hatching time, and percentages of total hatch, viable hatch, and postmature eggs that failed to hatch were optimized at intermediate salinities (about 15‰), low temperatures (3–5 C), and over a wide range of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Pacific cod eggs are judged to be euryhaline, euryoxic, and stenothermal. As long as temperatures are within the range of about 3–5 C, the developing egg is tolerant of a wide range of salinities, and of dissolved oxygen levels to a minimum of about 2 or 3 ppm. Below 3 C developmental success decreases precipitously; above 5 C it attenuates more slowly.Distribution and abundance of Pacific cod are reviewed in light of the experimental results. Temperature is suggested to be of major importance to successful egg development in the natural environment; the temperature range associated with reasonable egg viability and incubation success is estimated to extend from about 2.5 to 8.5 C.The distribution of cod in the spawning season appears associated with water temperatures between 2.5 and 8.5 C in Asian waters. Near the southern limit of cod distribution on the North American coast the following associations are suggested in relation to temperatures of the upper mixed layer of coastal waters in the spawning period: limit of commercial abundance, 9 C; extent of limited commercial landings, 10 C; limit of occurrence, 13.5 C.},

Based on a mixed layer temperature budget, these anomalies were caused by lower than normal rates of the loss of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere and of relatively weak cold advection in the upper ocean. Both of these mechanisms can be attributed to an unusually strong and persistent weather pattern featuring much higher than normal sea level pressure over the waters of interest. This anomaly was the greatest observed in this region since at least the 1980s. The region of warm sea surface temperature anomalies subsequently expanded and reached coastal waters in spring and summer 2014. Impacts on fisheries and regional weather are discussed. It is found that sea surface temperature anomalies in this region affect air temperatures downwind in Washington state.},

However, vital rates of early life stages ofthis species have yet to be described in detail. We determined the thermal sensitivity of growth rates ofembryos, preflexion and postflexion larvae, and postsettlement juveniles. Growth rates (length and mass) ateach ontogenetic stage were measured in three replicate tanks at four to five temperatures. Nonlinear regressionwas used to obtain parameters for independent stage-specific growth functions and a unified size- and temperature-dependent growth function. Specific growth rates increased with temperature at all stages and generallydecreased with increases in body size. However, these analyses revealed a departure from a strict size-basedallometry in growth patterns, as reduced growth rates were observed among preflexion larvae: the reduction in specific growth rate between embryos and free-swimming larvaewas greater than expected based on body size differences. Growth reductions in the preflexion larvae appear to be associated with increased metabolic rates and the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding. Infuture studies, experiments should be integrated across life transitions to more clearly define intrinsic ontogenetic and size-dependent growth patterns because these are critical for evaluations of spatial and temporalvariation in habitat quality.},

The consequences for growth and survival of early and late hatching larvae were examined in pre-feeding Pacific cod larvae under varying temperatures (i.e. 0–8°C) in the laboratory. As expected, time-to-first hatch and variation in time-to-hatch were negatively correlated with temperature. Larvae successfully hatched in the 0°C treatment, but hatch rates were poorer at this temperature relative to other temperature treatments. Size-at-hatch and the maximum size achieved during the pre-feeding larval stage were highest in the 0–4°C treatments, indicating that these temperatures are likely optimal for the conversion of endogenous resources to growth. At all temperatures, early hatching larvae were smaller but had more lipid reserves and survived longer after hatch in the absence of food than late hatching larvae. Together these data suggest that temperature fluctuations in the North Pacific have direct potential to impact the size, growth and endogenous reserves of Pacific cod larvae, which in turn, will likely influence survival through interactions with the prey and predator field.},

	abstract = {The match-mismatch hypothesis predicts that variability in spring primary production will increase starvation risk for marine fish populations. However, it is often unclear whether the synergic effects of temperature, phytoplankton phenology and metabolic demands of fish support these prediction within and across regions. In this study, we combine experimentally-derived rates of larval survival in relation to water temperature with satellite remote-sensing estimates of chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature to predict habitat quality of first feeding Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) larvae in two adjacent large marine ecosystems; southeast Bering Sea (BS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Predictions are made from 1998 to 2019, a period comprised of both warm and cool springs, followed by a series of extreme warming events (heatwaves) beginning in 2014. Model results indicate that the drivers of a mismatch between cod larvae and their food is fundamentally different between the two systems. In the GOA, larval habitat suitability is highly dependent on interannual fluctuations in sea surface temperature that regulate yolk reserves in embryos. In contrast, larval habitat suitability in the BS was more sensitive to the onset of the surface expression of Chl a production. The combined effects of changes in timing of Chl a and increased metabolic demands of larvae were captured by the model during the GOA marine heatwave (2014–16, 2019), which predicted significant loss of larval habitat across the entire region. These habitat models integrate important spatial, temporal and physiological components of match-mismatch theory that can be used to examine marine fish populations experiencing different rates of climate stress across regions.},

However, Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and other gadids continue to thrive in the Bering Sea despite delayed prey production resulting from warming and loss of sea ice. In this study, we examined how temperature mediates growth and survival of Pacific cod larvae under varying match–mismatch conditions. Cod larvae were reared at two temperatures (3 °C and 8 °C) and exposed to one of five different food treatments over a 6-week period: (i) high food (HF) (match); (ii) low food (LF); (iii) HF then LF (HF–LF); and (iv) LF then HF (LF–HF) (2–4 mismatch); and (v) no food (NF) (complete mismatch). Results showed that cold environments allow Pacific cod larvae to bridge gaps in prey availability (i.e., timing and magnitude), but negatively impact survival over longer periods. Under warmer conditions, mismatches in prey significantly impacted growth and survival. However, both yolk reserves and compensatory growth mechanisms reduced the severity of mismatches occurring in the first 3 weeks of development. Our results demonstrate a clear need to incorporate the direct effects of temperature on fish larvae in food limitation models.},

These findings can provide an invaluable glimpse into potential future ocean changes, but only if the story they tell is accurately interpreted. Chlorophyll is not simply a measure of phytoplankton biomass, but also registers changes in intracellular pigmentation arising from light-driven (photoacclimation) and nutrient-driven physiological responses. Here, we show that the photoacclimation response is an important component of temporal chlorophyll variability across the global ocean. This attribution implies that contemporary relationships between chlorophyll changes and ocean warming are not indicative of proportional changes in productivity, as light-driven decreases in chlorophyll can be associated with constant or even increased photosynthesis. Extension of these results to future change, however, requires further evaluation of how the multifaceted stressors of a warmer, higher-CO2 world will impact plankton communities.},

To gauge the likelihood of population recovery following these extreme warming events, we investigate potential thermal stress on age-0 cohorts through a comprehensive analysis of juvenile cod abundance, condition, growth, and survival data collected from 15 years of beach seine surveys. Abundance was strongly negatively related to ocean temperature during the egg and larval phase (winter–spring), but age-0 cod were larger in the early summer following warm winter–spring temperatures. Body condition indices suggest that warm summers may improve energetic reserves prior to the first winter; however, there was no summer temperature effect on post-settlement growth or survival. Spatial differences in abundance, condition, or growth were not detected, and density-dependent effects were either weak or positive. While the positive effects of increased summer temperatures on juvenile condition may benefit overwintering survival, they cannot compensate for high pre-settlement mortality from warming winter–spring temperatures. We conclude the critical thermal bottleneck for juvenile abundance occurs pre-settlement.},

As such, fisheries managers are exploring new recruitment paradigms for Pacific cod under novel environmental conditions. In this review, we address the challenges of managing and forecasting Pacific cod populations in the Eastern Pacific where thermal habitats for early life stages are undergoing varying rates of change across space and time. We use observational data to examine changes in distribution, abundance and demographics of the population from 1993 to 2020, and model contemporary and future changes of thermal habitat for both spawning success and age-0 juvenile growth potential. Results indicate that reduced spawning habitat and early life stage abundance may be a precursor to regional population decline, but the recent apparent increases in size-at-age of pre-recruits will have unknown impacts on future recruitment in these regions. We contend that continued monitoring of early life stages will be necessary to track changes in phenology and growth that likely determine size-at-age and the survival trajectories of year classes into the adult population. These include complex size- and temperature-dependent energetics spanning seasonal habitats through the first winter. Climate-ready management of Pacific cod will, therefore, require new process investigations beyond single-season surveys focused on one-life stage.},

Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.},

	abstract = {In dairy cattle, endometritis is a severe infectious disease that occurs following parturition. It is clear that genetic factors are involved in the etiology of endometritis, however, the molecular pathogenesis of endometritis is not entirely understood. In this study, a system biology approach was used to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of endometritis. Forty transcriptomic datasets comprising of 20 RNA-Seq (GSE66825) and 20 miRNA-Seq (GSE66826) were obtained from the GEO database. Next, the co-expressed modules were constructed based on RNA-Seq (Rb-modules) and miRNA-Seq (mb-modules) data, separately, using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) approach. Preservation analysis was used to find the non-preserved Rb-modules in endometritis samples. Afterward, the non-preserved Rb-modules were assigned to the mb-modules to construct the integrated regulatory networks. Just highly connected genes (hubs) in the networks were considered and functional enrichment analysis was used to identify the biological pathways associated with the development of the disease. Furthermore, additional bioinformatic analysis including protein–protein interactions network and miRNA target prediction were applied to enhance the reliability of the results. Thirty-five Rb-modules and 10 mb-modules were identified and 19 and 10 modules were non-preserved, respectively, which were enriched in biological pathways related to endometritis like inflammation and ciliogenesis. Two non-preserved Rb-modules were significantly assigned to three mb-modules and three and two important sub-networks in the Rb-modules were identified, respectively, including important mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs genes like IRAK1, CASP3, CCDC40, CCDC39, ZMYND10, FOXJ1, TLR4, IL10, STAT3, FN1, AKT1, CD68, ENSBTAG00000049936, ENSBTAG00000050527, ENSBTAG00000051242, ENSBTAG00000049287, bta-miR-449, bta-miR-484, bta-miR-149, bta-miR-30b and bta-miR-423. The potential roles of these genes have been previously demonstrated in endometritis or related pathways, which reinforced putative functions of the suggested integrated regulatory networks in the endometritis pathogenesis. These findings may help further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of bovine endometritis.},

However, systematic profiles of lncRNAs in the biological responses of Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) to pathogen infection have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we have conducted an exhaustive comparative transcriptome analysis using a bioinformatics approach to exam the functions of lncRNAs response to Ostreid herpesvirus 1μVar (OsHV-1μVar) challenge. In total, 101 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNA) during OsHV-1μVar infections were identified. Compared with differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNA), DE-lncRNAs are shorter in terms of overall length but longer in terms of exon length. These lncRNAs shared similar characteristics with previously reported invertebrate lncRNAs, such as relatively low GC content, low exon number and low sequence conservation, but low expression level were not observed. 20 DE-lncRNAs are typically co-expressed with their neighboring genes annotated as GO terms (GO: 0044237), indicating that these lncRNAs are involved in binding and cellular process functions in cis mode. The weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) analysis resulted in 15 modules. The highlighted blue module was specifically demonstrated a co-expression relationship between 14 DE-lncRNAs and 17 immune-related DE-mRNAs (IR-DE-mRNA). Three hub lncRNAs within this module were co-expressed with one hub IR-DE-mRNA involved in fibrinogen-related protein. It was speculated that lncRNAs is extensively involved in oyster antiviral innate immune system. The present study will facilitate subsequently experimental studies to unravel the function of lncRNAs in marine invertebrate response to pathogen infection.},

	abstract = {Triploid bivalves, specifically oysters, have become an increasingly popular aquaculture product over the last 3 decades due to their superior growth and meat quality. Despite a significant growth advantage, there remain surprisingly few consistent physiological or metabolic differences between diploid and triploid bivalves. This review summarizes the technical approaches used for triploid production before focusing on how triploidy affects key physiological performances, including growth and survivorship, tolerance to environmental stressors, resistance to disease, and immune performances. Survival trends appear to be similar between diploid and triploid oysters, though some immunological features appear to be enhanced in the larger cells present in triploid animals. Broad disease trends also appear to be similar between diploid and triploid oysters, although this topic remains relatively under-investigated and infrequently considers the genetic background of evaluated stocks, hence large knowledge gaps concerning how ploidy may influence host-parasite dynamics remain. Triploid oysters also seem to be equally capable of tolerating common environmental stressors, but coinciding stress appears to impact them more severely than diploids. The vast majority of work concerning triploid bivalves derive from field-based studies and as such considerable knowledge gaps exist outside of growth and survival prompting the need for more controlled approaches. Specifically, the impact of larger triploid cells that contain 50\% more DNA on basic molecular and cellular functioning remains largely unexplored and may represent a fertile ground for fundamental and applied research.},

Diploid crosses were also produced using the wild broodstocks to verify expected differences in low-salinity tolerance among diploid progeny and between ploidy levels. All progeny were deployed at low and moderate-salinity (averages of 9.3 and 19.4) field sites to monitor monthly growth and mortality. Sex ratio, gametogenic stage, gonad-to-body ratio, condition index, and Perkinsus marinus infection were also measured periodically at both field sites Although high triploid mortality at the low-salinity site prevented complete analysis, results indicated that diploid parentage had little effect on triploid survival at low salinity. Broodstock parentage affected diploid mortality and growth, although results did not match with predictions made based on historical salinity at broodstock collection sites.

Triploid oysters have also been observed to show reduced resistance to stress and disease compared with diploid oysters. We compared the transcriptional patterns of diploid and triploid Pacific Oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in response to acute and prolonged thermal stress. The survival rate of triploid C. gigas was lower than that of diploid oysters after prolonged heat stress at 28 °C. A total of 779 and 396 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in diploid and triploid oysters exposed to acute heat stress, respectively, and the number of DEGs was 418 in diploids and 483 in triploids after prolonged heat stress. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway in both diploid and triploid C. gigas under heat stress. Genes encoding translation initiation factors, including MKNK1, eIF4G3, eIF2a kinase 1, and eIF2a kinase 3, were differentially expressed under acute heat stress in diploid oysters. The number of differentially expressed HSP and IAP genes was greater in diploids than in triploids under acute heat stress, and the expression levels of most of these HSP and IAP genes were higher in diploid oysters than in triploid oysters. Overall, our findings revealed differences in the response of diploid and triploid C. gigas to thermal stress. Triploid C. gigas might be less capable of rapidly modifying the inflammatory response and apoptosis in response to heat stress compared with diploid C. gigas. Different genetic lines of diploid and tetraploid oysters should be used to produce triploid oysters with increased stress resistance.},

No significant differences were found between diploid and triploid oysters in rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion at either temperature. Biochemical composition (total protein, carbohydrate, lipid and ash) was similar for both groups at ambient temperature. At elevated temperature, however, triploid oysters had significantly higher levels of carbohydrate (P ≤ 0.016) and protein (P≤0.003) than diploid oysters. Both diploid and triploid oysters developed gametes at ambient temperature, but gonadal development in triploid individuals was 60–80\% lower than in diploid individuals. At elevated temperature, 92\% of the diploids were found to be ripe, compared to 0\% of the triploids. The greater dry tissue weight, condition index, and protein and carbohydrate levels of triploid oyster at 30°C may be attributable to their decreased reproductive effort compared to diploids, thereby giving triploid oysters an energetic advantage at stressful temperatures.},

Response of the ocean mixed layer depth to global warming and its impact on primary production: a case for the North Pacific Ocean. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 996–1007.This study investigates changes in the mixed layer depth (MLD) in the North Pacific Ocean in response to global warming and their impact on primary production by comparing outputs from 11 models of the coupled model intercomparison projects phase 3. The MLD in the 21st century decreases in most regions of the North Pacific, whereas the spatial pattern of the MLD is nearly unchanged. The overall shoaling results in part from intensified upper-ocean stratification caused by both surface warming and freshening. A significant MLD decrease (\&gt;30 m) is found in the Kuroshio extension (KE), which is predominantly driven by reduced surface cooling, caused by weakening of wind. Associated with the mixed layer shoaling in the KE, the primary production component resulting from seasonal vertical mixing will be reduced by 10.7–40.3\% (ranges of medians from 11 models) via decreased nitrate fluxes from below it. Spring blooms in most models are projected to initiate earlier in the KE by 0–13 d (ranges of medians from 11 models). Despite the overall trends, the magnitude of changes in primary production and timing of spring blooms are quite different depending on models and latitudes.},

Consequently, there is a strong need for alternative diets to replace live microalgae as food for bivalves in commercial and research hatcheries. This article initially reviews the literature on the nutritional requirements of bivalves and continues with a review of the development of alternative and artificial diets for bivalves. Although a limited number of such diets have been assessed experimentally, their nutritional value is currently limited by a general lack of knowledge of the nutritional requirements of bivalves. The importance of the development of artificial diets, whose nutritional composition can be precisely manipulated, in order to study bivalve nutrition is emphasized. In the absence of clearly defined artificial diets, dietary vehicles such as microcapsules and spray-dried microalgae are currently the most promising tools to study the nutritional requirements of bivalves.},

	abstract = {Mass mortalities of oysters were recorded in the South of the Bay of Marennes-Oleron, during spring 1988. The percentages of mortality averaged 50 \% and reached up to 90 \% in some areas of bottom culture. The losses were estimated to 7 800 tonnes. This paper present the results of the investigations carried out in several fields. Among them, pathological examination revealed that no pathogenic agent or parasitic infestation could be evoked to explain these mortalities. Analyses of pollutants were either negatives, or the concentrations were far below the toxicity levels. Climatological and hydrological observations showed that rainfalls were twice more abundant then the average, for a period of 6 months preceding the mortalities. The salinity was low and fluctuating in the area, and the temperature was warmer, then the average during the same period. Phytoplanktonic blooms were recorded only by the end of May, latter then usual. These ecological changes resulted in a poor physiological condition of the oysters, which became critical for the grounds located at the South of the bay. Both their high tidal position and low quantities of phytoplankton are characteristic of this area. The high densities of oysters in the parks were also evoked as contributing to the establishment of such critical conditions.},

Here, we present the first large-scale, high-resolution spatial and temporal representation of a mass mortality phenomenon cause by the Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1) that has affected oysters (Crassostrea gigas) every year since 2008, in relation to their energetic reserves and the quality of their food. Disease mortality was investigated in healthy oysters deployed at 106 locations in the Thau Mediterranean lagoon before the start of the epizootic in spring 2011. We found that disease mortality of oysters showed strong spatial dependence clearly reflecting the epizootic process of local transmission. Disease initiated inside oyster farms spread rapidly beyond these areas. Local differences in energetic condition of oysters, partly driven by variation in food quality, played a significant role in the spatial and temporal dynamics of disease mortality. In particular, the relative contribution of diatoms to the diet of oysters was positively correlated with their energetic reserves, which in turn decreased the risk of disease mortality.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Thau Lagoon is an important oyster farming area in Europe. Oyster growth rates are among the highest in France, although chlorophyll a concentration is low. Previous studies have demonstrated that picophytoplankton,
nano-microphytoplankton, dinoflagellates and loricate ciliates such as tintinnids are abundant. However, heterotrophic flagellates and aloricate ciliates have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess picophytoplankton, protist and
zooplankton abundances in the Lagoon and to investigate the particular structure of the microbial food web, which may explain such paradoxical oyster growth. In oligotrophic waters in the Thau Lagoon, the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus tauri is the
dominant autotrophic picoplankter, with an abundance maximum in summer. On 17 August 1998, following a rainfall event, pico- and nanophytoplankton abundances were not as high as expected and we observed a high abundance of large diatoms. At this time, the
available carbon resources were produced by microphytoplankton (84.5{\textbackslash}\#000), and picoplanktonic cells represented only 1.27{\textbackslash}\#000 in terms of carbon. Heterotrophic cells were low in abundance and constituted {\textless}14{\textbackslash}\#000 of carbon resources. In order to
evaluate the importance of the Œprotozoan trophic link¹ for energy transfer from the microbial food web to large benthic suspension feeders, the oyster Crassostrea gigas was offered a planktonic community as potential prey. In the grazing
experiment, all {\textgreater}5 µm flagellates, microphytoplankton, dinoflagellates, ciliates and large zooplankton were retained by the oyster gills. Only flagellates {\textless}5 µm and O. tauri were not very well retained (45 and 2{\textbackslash}\#000 respectively). The
high clearance rates of C. gigas found in this experiment can be explained by a low concentration of suspended particulate matter (0.65 mg l-1). The oysters adapted their retention mechanism when they lived in oligotrophic
waters. These results indicate that, under the given experimental conditions, picophytoplankton did not represent a valuable trophic resource for farmed oysters because (1) C. gigas cannot retain picoparticles and (2) the picoplankton represented a
poor carbon resource capable of being transferred via a weak heterotrophic protist community. In the oyster pens of the Thau Lagoon during this study, microphytoplanktonic primary producers, in particular diatoms, were the main food sources for bivalve
suspension feeders.},

	abstract = {Microalgae commonly used as feed for bivalves, Pavlova lutheri (P), Isochrysis affinis galbana (T) and Chaetoceros calcitrans forma pumilum (Cp), were fed to Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to assess their nutritional value for larval development and metamorphosis during two experiments. Monospecific, bispecific and trispecific diets were firstly evaluated during 3weeks from D larvae to young postlarvae. Then bispecific diets, based on different T and Cp proportions, were assessed during a similar period. Concurrently, ingestion was studied through the whole larval and postlarval development for each diet and/or diet mixture. Because lipids are assumed to be a key nutrient for bivalves, biochemical analysis was undertaken on the second set of trials focused on fatty acids and sterols. Compared to the other diet mixtures (mono and plurispecific diet) TCp induced the best larval growth performance (13.2μm day−1), a high larval survival (98\%) but did not result in higher metamorphosis (72\%). In contrast, monospecific diet P was the poorest for larvae with low growth and low survival. When varying T and Cp proportions, best larval developments were induced with 25T/75Cp and 50T/50Cp diets, though quite similar to that obtained with 75T/25Cp. In contrast, unbalanced diets (95T/5Cp and 95Cp/5T) led to low larval performances. In addition, grazing experiences showed preferential uptake of microalgae with P{\textless}PT≪T≪Cp≪TCp=PCp=PTCp. For mixed diets a low daily consumption ({\textless}10000 microalgae per larvae) was noted during the first week followed by a second phase (next 8–10days) with a sharp increase and regular intake, reaching 90000 microalgae per larvae per day. Finally, a marked drop (40000 microalgae per larvae) was observed at the beginning of metamorphosis from days 20 to 21. Principal component analysis between main fatty acids (19) and sterols (7) detected in larvae and postlarvae was used to discriminate profiles according to diets and/or metamorphosis competence. The correlation circle representation showed that the 26 variables are well explained by these combined variables (78\%) with a repartition along the first principal component according to diets with a gradient from 5T/95Cp to 95T/5Cp. In contrast, postlarvae and larvae were discriminated on the second principal component while no relationships were found between competent and incompetent larvae.},

Aquaculture is currently the fastest-growing food production sector globally and a sustainable option for attaining food security. Food as a basic necessity for man’s survival is always a timely issue. Hence, owing to aquaculture’s unique role, it is expected that the demand for aquatic products (especially seafood) will continue to increase due to geometric population growth. Many seafood products are among the critical protein sources in the world. This is partly because they have micronutrients and essential fatty acids that are not present in land-based protein sources. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, shellfish is one of the main cultured aquaculture groups in the world. Hence, the development of shellfish aquaculture has an important role in sustainable food supply and food security. In this article, an overview of the current and projected contributions of shellfish aquaculture to global food security is presented. Apparently, shellfish aquaculture in the next few decades will have to be intensified to bridge the gap between demand and supply in a cost-effective manner. Also, food waste would have to be reduced and natural resources should be used more efficiently to minimize the negative impacts on aquaculture on the environment.},

Currently, global oyster aquaculture production is dominated by China, who accounted for 86\% of global production by weight in 2016. Beyond China, production is stagnant, and is limited by disease, parasites, and regulatory issues, depending on the country. There appears to be increasing demand for farmed oysters that producers are not able to exploit due to the supply side issues that have limited total production. Additionally, a test for market integration found that there is no global market. Hence, while the increasing prices in some markets provides an opportunity, this is exploited only to a limited extent with Canadian exports to the United States as the best example.},

	abstract = {The Pacific oyster (Crassostreae gigas) has been introduced from Asia to numerous countries around the world during the 20th century. C. gigas is the main oyster species farmed worldwide and represents more than 98\% of oyster production. The severity of disease outbreaks that affect C. gigas, which primarily impact juvenile oysters, has increased dramatically since 2008. The most prevalent disease, Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS), has become panzootic and represents a threat to the oyster industry. Recently, major steps towards understanding POMS have been achieved through integrative molecular approaches. These studies demonstrated that infection by Ostreid herpesvirus type 1 µVar (OsHV-1 µvar) is the first critical step in the infectious process and leads to an immunocompromised state by altering hemocyte physiology. This is followed by dysbiosis of the microbiota, which leads to a secondary colonization by opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which in turn results in oyster death. Host and environmental factors (e.g. oyster genetics and age, temperature, food availability, and microbiota) have been shown to influence POMS permissiveness. However, we still do not understand the mechanisms by which these different factors control disease expression. The present review discusses current knowledge of this polymicrobial and multifactorial disease process and explores the research avenues that must be investigated to fully elucidate the complexity of POMS. These discoveries will help in decision-making and will facilitate the development of tools and applied innovations for the sustainable and integrated management of oyster aquaculture.},

To further investigate the physiological and metabolism changes in Manila clam that had experienced a heat stress, non-targeted metabolomics (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze the metabolic responses of gills in three group Manila clams during the heat challenge. Metabolic profiles revealed that high temperature caused changes in fatty acid composition, energy metabolism, antioxidant metabolites, hydroxyl compounds, and amino acids in heat-hardened clams compared to non-hardened clams. We found a number of significantly enriched pathways, including cAMP signaling pathway, serotonergic synapse, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in heat-hardened Manila clam compared with non-hardened and untreated Manila clam. After a brief high temperature treatment, the physiological maintenance ability of Manila clam was improved. Combined with metabolomics analysis, heat hardening treatment may improve the energy metabolism and antioxidant ability of Manila clam. These results provide new insights into the cellular and metabolic responses of Manila clams following high temperature stress.},

Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1) is a temperature-associated pathogen that predominantly affects the commercially important Pacific Oyster (Magallana gigas) and other species around the world, with some µVars causing {\textgreater} 95\% mortality of oyster stocks. Over the course of three studies, we explored the utility of stress hardening (SH) in ameliorating the effects of MHWs (Chapter 1) and disease outbreaks (Chapter 2) by exposing multiple oyster species to a stressor before the onset of an event as well as a comprehensive overview of OsHV-1 detections in different locations and hosts (Chapter 3). In Chapter 1, we exposed juvenile Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida), Kumamoto oysters (Crassostrea sikamea), and M. gigas to a two-week-long SH phase that involved exposure to a combination of temperature (15˚C v. 21˚C) and tide (immersion v. 6-hour tidal cycle) prior to a 72-hour simulated MHW at one of four temperatures (15˚C, 18˚C, 21˚C, 24˚C). Once the MHWs ended, a portion of O. lurida seed were grouped by their SH treatments, outplanted in Tomales Bay, CA, USA, and then assessed for mortality after nine months. Outplanted O. lurida that experienced tidal SH had perished by the time they were retrieved 279 days later. In contrast, 53.4\% of O. lurida fully immersed during SH at 21˚C survived outplanting, while only 13.3\% of those in the 15˚C SH treatment remained. Less than 10\% of oysters across all species perished during the SH and MHW phases of the experiment, with C. sikamea experiencing the greatest losses. For Chapter 2, we investigated the effects of laboratory-based stress hardening (SH) via temperature (15˚C/16˚C v. 21˚C) and tide (tidal cycle vs. full submersion) on M. gigas and C. sikamea with the expectation that short-term exposure to warmer conditions and a simulated tidal regime would improve the performance of outplanted oysters. In 2021 and 2022, we exposed oysters to SH mechanisms before outplanting oysters at three sites spanning a thermal gradient in Tomales Bay, where they were exposed to OsHV-1 outbreaks in the field. We compared these outcomes to a baseline study completed in 2020, where M. gigas that had not been conditioned were exposed to OsHV-1 at two sites. M. gigas submerged in the warmer SH treatment had lower mortality in 2021, and those that experienced tidal fluctuations during SH had higher growth rates in 2022. In 2021, we saw no effect of SH on C. sikamea growth or mortality, but oysters were infected with OsHV-1. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide OsHV-1 copy numbers (mg tissue-1) for C. sikamea. In Chapter 3, we used peer-reviewed literature, government reports, and unpublished data to describe the timeline of OsHV-1 variant detections, countries where M. gigas has tested positive, and other known hosts. We also summarized mean prevalence and peak infection intensity when that information was provided in the studies we assessed. Overall, SH has the potential to improve the resilience of aquaculture impacted by MHWs and disease, but it, along with the database of OsHV-1 detections we collated here, will likely be best used as part of an array of solutions addressing the multifaceted effects of climate change.},

	abstract = {The global production of marine bivalves for human consumption is more than 15 million tonnes per year (average period 2010–2015), which is about 14\% of the total marine production in the world. Most of the marine bivalve production (89\%) comes from aquaculture and only 11\% comes from the wild fishery. Asia, especially China, is by far the largest producer of marine bivalves, accounting for 85\% of the world production and responsible for the production growth. In other continents, the production is stabilizing or decreasing (Europe) the last decades. In order to stimulate growth, sustainability (Planet, Profit, People) of the aquaculture activities is a key issue. Environmental (Planet) aspects for sustainable aquaculture include the fishery on seed resources, carrying capacity, invasive species and organic loading. Food safety issues due to environmental contaminants and biotoxines should be minimized to increase the reliability of marine bivalves as a healthy food source and to stimulate market demands. Properly designed monitoring programs are important tools to accomplish sustainable growth of marine bivalve production.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification significantly affects marine calcifiers like oysters, warranting the study of molecular mechanisms that contribute to adaptive plasticity in response to environmental change like DNA methylation. However, a consensus has not been reached on the extent to which methylation modules gene expression, and in turn plasticity, in marine invertebrates. To this end, we investigated the impact of pCO2 on gene expression and DNA methylation in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. After a 30-day exposure to control (572 ppm) or elevated pCO2 (2,827 ppm), whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-Seq data were generated from adult female gonad and male sperm samples. Although differentially methylated loci (DML) were identified in female (89) and male (2,916) gonad tissues, there were no differentially expressed genes, and only one differentially expressed transcript in females. However, gene body methylation impacted other transcript-level processes in sperm, such as the maximum number of transcripts expressed per gene and shifts in the predominant transcript. Elevated pCO2 exposure increased gene expression variability (transcriptional noise) in males but decreased noise in females, suggesting a sex-specific role of methylation in gene expression regulation. Functional annotation of genes with changes in transcript-level expression or containing DML revealed several enriched biological processes potentially involved in elevated pCO2 response, including apoptotic pathways and signal transduction, as well as reproductive functions. Taken together, these results suggest that DNA methylation may regulate gene expression variability to maintain homeostasis in elevated pCO2 conditions and could play a key role in environmental resilience in marine invertebrates.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play important roles in regulating gene expression. The majority of miRNAs are transcribed from DNA sequences into primary miRNAs and processed into precursor miRNAs, and finally mature miRNAs. In most cases, miRNAs interact with the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target mRNAs to induce mRNA degradation and translational repression. However, interaction of miRNAs with other regions, including the 5′ UTR, coding sequence, and gene promoters, have also been reported. Under certain conditions, miRNAs can also activate translation or regulate transcription. The interaction of miRNAs with their target genes is dynamic and dependent on many factors, such as subcellular location of miRNAs, the abundancy of miRNAs and target mRNAs, and the affinity of miRNA-mRNA interactions. miRNAs can be secreted into extracellular fluids and transported to target cells via vesicles, such as exosomes, or by binding to proteins, including Argonautes. Extracellular miRNAs function as chemical messengers to mediate cell-cell communication. In this review, we provide an update on canonical and non-canonical miRNA biogenesis pathways and various mechanisms underlying miRNA-mediated gene regulations. We also summarize the current knowledge of the dynamics of miRNA action and of the secretion, transfer, and uptake of extracellular miRNAs.},

The term ‘lncRNAs’ encompasses RNA polymerase I (Pol I), Pol II and Pol III transcribed RNAs, and RNAs from processed introns. The various functions of lncRNAs and their many isoforms and interleaved relationships with other genes make lncRNA classification and annotation difficult. Most lncRNAs evolve more rapidly than protein-coding sequences, are cell type specific and regulate many aspects of cell differentiation and development and other physiological processes. Many lncRNAs associate with chromatin-modifying complexes, are transcribed from enhancers and nucleate phase separation of nuclear condensates and domains, indicating an intimate link between lncRNA expression and the spatial control of gene expression during development. lncRNAs also have important roles in the cytoplasm and beyond, including in the regulation of translation, metabolism and signalling. lncRNAs often have a modular structure and are rich in repeats, which are increasingly being shown to be relevant to their function. In this Consensus Statement, we address the definition and nomenclature of lncRNAs and their conservation, expression, phenotypic visibility, structure and functions. We also discuss research challenges and provide recommendations to advance the understanding of the roles of lncRNAs in development, cell biology and disease.},

Cnidarians, the sister group to bilaterians, are at a critical phylogenetic node to better model eukaryotic small RNA pathway evolution. To date, most of our understanding of sRNA regulation and its potential contribution to evolution has been limited to a few triploblastic bilaterian and plant models. The diploblastic nonbilaterians, including the cnidarians, are understudied in this regard. Therefore, this review will present the current‐known small RNA information in cnidarians to enhance our understanding of the development of the small RNA pathways in early branch animals.},

	abstract = {In bilaterians, which comprise most of extant animals, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the majority of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) via base-pairing of a short sequence (the miRNA “seed”) to the target, subsequently promoting translational inhibition and transcript instability. In plants, many miRNAs guide endonucleolytic cleavage of highly complementary targets. Because little is known about miRNA function in nonbilaterian animals, we investigated the repertoire and biological activity of miRNAs in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a representative of Cnidaria, the sister phylum of Bilateria. Our work uncovers scores of novel miRNAs in Nematostella, increasing the total miRNA gene count to 87. Yet only a handful are conserved in corals and hydras, suggesting that microRNA gene turnover in Cnidaria greatly exceeds that of other metazoan groups. We further show that Nematostella miRNAs frequently direct the cleavage of their mRNA targets via nearly perfect complementarity. This mode of action resembles that of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and plant miRNAs. It appears to be common in Cnidaria, as several of the miRNA target sites are conserved among distantly related anemone species, and we also detected miRNA-directed cleavage in Hydra. Unlike in bilaterians, Nematostella miRNAs are commonly coexpressed with their target transcripts. In light of these findings, we propose that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs functions differently in Cnidaria and Bilateria. The similar, siRNA-like mode of action of miRNAs in Cnidaria and plants suggests that this may be an ancestral state.},

However, farmers of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and Atlantic coast estuaries have observed unresolved, late-spring die-offs of triploid oysters, threatening the sustainability of triploid aquaculture. To investigate this, the physiological processes underlying oyster growth (e.g., feeding, respiration) and mortality of one-year-old diploid and triploid oysters were compared in early summer following an uptick in mortality. It was predicted that higher triploid mortality was the result of energetic imbalances (increased metabolic demands and decreased feeding behavior). Oyster clearance rates, percentage of time valves were open, absorption efficiency, oxygen consumption rates (basal and routine), ammonia excretion rate were measured in the laboratory and scope for growth was calculated. In addition, their condition index, gametogenic stage, Perkinsus marinus infection intensity, and mortality were measured. Mortality of triploids in the laboratory was greater than for diploids, mirroring mortality observed in a related field study. The physiological parameters measured, however, could not explain triploid mortality. Scope for growth, condition index, and clearance rates of triploids were greater than for diploids, suggesting sufficient energy reserves, while all other measurements where similar between the ploidies. It remains to be determined whether mortality could be caused from disruption of energy homeostasis at the cellular level.},

	abstract = {Rapid growth rate and partial sterility have made triploid eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) the most popular crop variety for the Virginia oyster aquaculture industry, typically comprising greater than 90\% of larvae and juvenile sales. Triploid advantages, however, sometimes come with the disadvantage of higher mortality in late spring and early summer, dubbed “triploid mortality.” In recent years, farms up and down the East Coast, especially Maryland and south into the Gulf of Mexico have experienced triploid mortality. Some of the reports include observations of elevated triploid fecundity. Triploid oysters are created by crossing tetraploids to diploids, and much of the commercial broodstock is acquired through the Virginia Institute of Marine Science Aquaculture Genetics and Breeding Technology Center (ABC). Tetraploid oysters are created from fecund triploid females and propagated favoring the most fertile tetraploids. We hypothesized that heritable fertility may be transferred to the commercial product, possibly yielding fertile triploid oysters. To investigate this possibility, twelve half-sibling families were produced by crossing individual tetraploid males with aliquots from a pooled source of eggs from diploid females. Tetraploid males came from tetraploid lines bred for one, two, five, or eight generations. Two replicates of each family were deployed to two sites: a site known for episodes of triploid mortality on the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay, and at a control site in the Rappahannock River. Temperature and salinity exhibited typical patterns at both sites while oysters were raised to market size. When compared to the control site, cumulative mortality of triploid oysters at the Eastern Shore location was significantly higher, with significantly lower growth rate and fecundity; the latter measured by direct egg counts at peak ripeness. Diploid oysters performed similarly at both sites and exhibited significantly greater fecundity than triploids. Fecundity differed significantly among several triploid families based upon paternal lineage, but fecundity did not vary as a function of tetraploid lineage.},

	abstract = {Integrating the effects of multiple stressors and predicting their consequences for the species’ survival and distribution is an important problem in ecological physiology. This review applies the concept of energy-limited tolerance to stress to develop bioenergetic markers that can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and distinguishing between the moderate stress compatible with long-term survival of populations and bioenergetically unsustainable extreme stress. These markers reflect the progressive decline of the aerobic scope of an organism (defined as the fraction of the energy flux and metabolic power supporting this flux available after the basal maintenance costs of an organism are met) with increasing levels of the environmental stress. During the exposure to moderate stress (i.e., in the pejus range of the environmental conditions), the aerobic scope is positive but reduced compared with the optimum conditions. The reduction of the metabolic scope can be due to the (1) elevated costs of basal metabolism, (2) activation of the mechanisms for protection and damage repair, (3) reduced assimilation of food, and/or (4) stress-induced impacts on the aerobic pathways producing ATP. This leads to suboptimal growth and reproductive rates in the pejus range of environmental conditions and is commonly observed in food-limited and energy-limited wild populations. The tolerance windows of the organisms are delimited by the pessimum range(s) of environmental conditions in which the aerobic scope of the organism disappears (so that all available energy and metabolic capacity are used in support of basal metabolism), energy resources are depleted, and partial anaerobiosis and/or metabolic rate depression set in. The habitats where environmental conditions remain in the pessimum zone long enough to prevent consistent growth and reproduction often coincide with the species’ distributional limits. Thus, focus on the bioenergetic effects of environmental stressors and their immediate consequences for fitness provides a suitable framework for integrating physiology and functional ecology and can assist in understanding the driving forces and limitations of environmental adaptation and improving assessment of ecological risk as well as environmental management in field populations facing multiple stressors.},

	abstract = {Energy balance is a fundamental requirement of stress adaptation and tolerance. We explore the links between metabolism, energy balance and stress tolerance using aquatic invertebrates as an example and demonstrate that using key parameters of energy balance (aerobic scope for growth, reproduction and activity; tissue energy status; metabolic rate depression; and compensatory onset of anaerobiosis) can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and their interactions and in predicting the whole-organism and population-level consequences of environmental stress. We argue that limitations of both the amount of available energy and the rates of its acquisition and metabolic conversions result in trade-offs between basal maintenance of a stressed organism and energy costs of fitness-related functions such as reproduction, development and growth and can set limit to the tolerance of a broad range of environmental stressors. The degree of stress-induced disturbance of energy balance delineates transition from moderate stress compatible with population persistence (pejus range) to extreme stress where only time-limited existence is possible (pessimum range). It also determines the predominant adaptive strategy of metabolic responses (energy compensation vs. conservation) that allows an organism to survive the disturbance. We propose that energy-related biomarkers can be used to determine the conditions when these metabolic transitions occur and thus predict ecological consequences of stress exposures. Bioenergetic considerations can also provide common denominator for integrating stress responses and predicting tolerance limits under the environmentally realistic scenarios when multiple and often variable stressors act simultaneously on an organism. Determination of bioenergetic sustainability at the organism's level (or lack thereof) has practical implications. It can help identify the habitats and/or conditions where a population can survive (even if at the cost of reduced reproduction and growth) and those that are incapable of supporting viable populations. Such an approach will assist in explaining and predicting the species' distribution limits in the face of the environmental change and informing the conservation efforts and resource management practices.},

	abstract = {Metazoans must develop from zygotes to feeding organisms. In doing so, developing offspring consume up to 60\% of the energy provided by their parent. The cost of development depends on two rates: metabolic rate, which determines the rate that energy is used; and developmental rate, which determines the length of the developmental period. Both development and metabolism are highly temperature-dependent such that developmental costs should be sensitive to the local thermal environment. Here, we develop, parameterize and test developmental cost theory, a physiologically explicit theory that reveals that ectotherms have narrow thermal windows in which developmental costs are minimized (Topt). Our developmental cost theory-derived estimates of Topt predict the natural thermal environment of 71 species across seven phyla remarkably well (R2 {\textasciitilde}0.83). Developmental cost theory predicts that costs of development are much more sensitive to small changes in temperature than classic measures such as survival. Warming-driven changes to developmental costs are predicted to strongly affect population replenishment and developmental cost theory provides a mechanistic foundation for determining which species are most at risk. Developmental cost theory predicts that tropical aquatic species and most non-nesting terrestrial species are likely to incur the greatest increase in developmental costs from future warming.},

	abstract = {The Thau lagoon, located at the South of France, provides 10\% of the French pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas production. Despite this intensive shellfish production, the larval recruitment of this species within the Thau lagoon is still misunderstood and spat collection remains highly variable; as a consequence, shellfish farmers rely mostly on hatchery”s spat. The present study aimed to describe reproduction features of C. gigas within the Mediterranean, as well as to explore spawning triggers of this species. To achieve this goal, the reproduction cycle from gametogenesis to spawning was followed during two years in several locations within the Mediterranean Thau lagoon. The spawning behavior of C. gigas within the Thau lagoon appeared to be slightly different from the one of the Atlantic Coast, showing several spawning events from June to October. The minimal temperature for massive spawning was 23°C, which is much higher than temperatures mentioned in the literature for this species. A strong relationship was found between phytoplankton communities and gametogenesis, the latter being improved by a higher diatom/dinoflagellate ratio. Temperature was insufficient alone to explain spawning, highlighting other potential triggers such as the moon or lightning strikes. We made the hypothesis of a hierarchy of events triggering spawning, encompassing locking, synchrony and intensifying triggers.
Statement of relevance
This paper is filling in a gap in the literature regarding to reproduction of C. gigas in the Thau lagoon, which is always associated to temperature. However, temperature may not be the only factor involved in oyster reproduction, that is what we tried to show in this paper.},

Recently, the production of aquaculture oysters is the most massive if compared with other bivalves. High demand for the oyster brings researcher interest to develop the research about supply chain topic because that is an essential issue for food security among producer and consumer. The high survival rate for oysters is one consideration for the farmer to straight-line keep the mollusk to harvest in any condition, which is growing well in the warm temperature. The shell length market of the oyster is about 80 shell length mm with a high-quality product. Aquaculture is more reliable to develop the oyster than wild capture because easier to treat, control, and produce reliably to meet market demand. Pacific oyster is profitable and marketable for seafood consumption. Lastly, traceability research should develop in the future for the oyster to reduce the risk of seafood security, waste, and boost the market value of the high-quality product.},

	abstract = {Maximum larval survival is realized when broodstock are in an optimum stage of gonadal development and the efficiency of larval culture may be substantially improved by using only optimally conditioned broodstock. The conditioning requirement to bring broodstock into this optimum stage is dependent upon the stage of gonadal development at the commencement of conditioning and upon the rate of conditioning. The stage of gonadal development at the commencement of conditioning may be determined directly or inferred by understanding the annual cycle of gonadal development occurring in the broodstock. The rate of conditioning, on the other hand, is regulated by the conditioning environment. In the present study, we have observed the influence of three components of the conditioning environment: temperature, salinity, and supplemental feeding on the rate of gonadal development during hatchery conditioning of broodstock. The rate of gonadal development is a function of temperature intensity and time rather than accumulated thermal exposure. Salinity exerted a negative influence on the rate of development in oysters conditioned at salinity levels below 30 parts per thousand (ppt). Furthermore, when oysters conditioned at 20 ppt relative to 30 ppt were spawned and the larvae were reared under standardized hatchery conditions, larval survival was markedly reduced in the former. Fecundity of broodstock was 60\% greater when fed an algal food supplement of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana relative to starved controls, although the rate of gonadal development and gamete viability was not significantly different. Using these empirically determined functions, a simplistic quatitative model may be employed to predict broodstock conditioning requirements in order to increase the proportion of optimally conditioned brood oysters.},

	abstract = {Climate change is not only causing steady increases in average global temperatures but also increasing the frequency with which extreme heating events occur. These extreme events may be pivotal in determining the ability of organisms to persist in their current habitats. Thus, it is important to understand how quickly an organism's heat tolerance can be gained and lost relative to the frequency with which extreme heating events occur in the field. We show that the California mussel, Mytilus californianus—a sessile intertidal species that experiences extreme temperature fluctuations and cannot behaviourally thermoregulate—can quickly (in 24–48 h) acquire improved heat tolerance after exposure to a single sublethal heat-stress bout (2 h at 30 or 35°C) and then maintain this improved tolerance for up to three weeks without further exposure to elevated temperatures. This adaptive response improved survival rates by approximately 75\% under extreme heat-stress bouts (2 h at 40°C). To interpret these laboratory findings in an ecological context, we evaluated 4 years of mussel body temperatures recorded in the field. The majority (approx. 64\%) of consecutive heat-stress bouts were separated by 24–48 h, but several consecutive heat bouts were separated by as much as 22 days. Thus, the ability of M. californianus to maintain improved heat tolerance for up to three weeks after a single sublethal heat-stress bout significantly improves their probability of survival, as approximately 33\% of consecutive heat events are separated by 3–22 days. As a sessile animal, mussels likely evolved the capability to rapidly gain and slowly lose heat tolerance to survive the intermittent, and often unpredictable, heat events in the intertidal zone. This adaptive strategy will likely prove beneficial under the extreme heat events predicted with climate change.},

We acclimated intertidal oysters to four treatment levels, including an antibiotic treatment, and then exposed all treatments to a 50°C heatwave for 2 h, replicating what can be experienced on Australian shorelines. We found that both acclimation and antibiotics increased survival and reduced the presence of potential pathogens. Non-acclimated oysters had a significant shift in their microbiome, with increasing abundances of bacteria from the Vibrio genera, including known potential pathogens. Our results demonstrate that bacterial infection plays a pivotal role in post-heatwave mortality.

Acute 3-day exposure to MHWs, mimicked by increasing the ambient seawater temperature from 24°C to 28°C, 32°C, and 36°C, respectively, induced significant changes (initially sustained increase and late decrease) in activities of antioxidant enzymes (GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, MDA, and T-AOC) and biomineralizaiton-related enzymes (AKP and ACP). Likewise, energy-metabolizing enzymes (NKA, CMA, and T-ATP) showed remarkable acute responses, with significant increases occurring at the beginning and end of thermal exposure. Following repeated exposure to MHWs, without exception, acute responses of assayed enzymes to MHWs were significantly alleviated, implying that pearl oysters have the ability to implement more efficient and less costly energy-utilizing strategies to compensate for thermal stress induced physiological interferences. These findings indicate that marine bivalves can respond plastically and acclimate rapidly to MHWs and pave the way for predicting the fate of this important taxonomic groups in rapidly changing oceans.},

	abstract = {Although thermal performance is widely recognised to be pivotal in determining species’ distributions, assessment of this performance is often based on laboratory-acclimated individuals, neglecting their proximate thermal history. The thermal history of a species sums the evolutionary history and, importantly, the thermal events recently experienced by individuals, including short-term acclimation to environmental variations. Thermal history is perhaps of greatest importance for species inhabiting thermally challenging environments and therefore assumed to be living close to their thermal limits, such as in the tropics. To test the importance of thermal history, the responses of the tropical oyster Isognomon nucleus to short-term differences in thermal environments were investigated. Critical and lethal temperatures and oxygen consumption were improved in oysters that previously experienced elevated air temperatures, and were associated with an enhanced heat shock response, indicating that recent thermal history affects physiological performance as well as inducing short-term acclimation to acute conditions. These responses were, however, associated with trade-offs in feeding activity, with oysters that experienced elevated temperatures showing reduced energy gain. Recent thermal history, therefore, seems to rapidly invoke physiological mechanisms that enhance survival of short-term thermal challenge but also longer term climatic changes and consequently needs to be incorporated into assessments of species’ thermal performances.},

	abstract = {Securing economically and ecologically significant molluscs, as our oceans warm due to climate change, is a global priority. South eastern Australia receives warm water in a strengthening East Australia Current and so resident species are vulnerable to elevated temperature and marine heat waves. This study tested whether prior exposure to elevated temperature can enhance resilience of oysters to ocean warming. Two Australian species, the flat oyster, Ostrea angasi, and the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, were obtained as adults and “heat shocked” by exposure to a dose of warm water in the laboratory. Oysters were then transferred to elevated seawater temperature conditions where the thermal outfall from power generation was used as a proxy to investigate the impacts of ocean warming. Shell growth, condition index, lipid content and survival of flat oysters and condition of Sydney rock oysters were all significantly reduced by elevated seawater temperature in the field. Flat oysters grew faster than Sydney rock oysters at ambient temperature, but their growth and survival was more sensitive to elevated temperature. “Stress inoculation” by heat shock did little to ameliorate the negative effects of increased temperature, although the survival of heat-shocked flat oysters was greater than non-heat shocked oysters. Further investigations are required to determine if early exposure to heat stress can enhance resilience of oysters to ocean warming.},

	abstract = {Climate change is forecasted to increase temperature variability and stochasticity. Most of our understanding of thermal physiology of intertidal organisms has come from laboratory experiments that acclimate organisms to submerged conditions and steady-state increases in temperatures. For organisms experiencing the ebb and flow of tides with unpredictable low tide aerial temperatures, the reliability of reported tolerances and thus predicted responses to climate change requires incorporation of environmental complexity into empirical studies. Using the mussel Mytilus californianus, our study examined how stochasticity of the thermal regime influences physiological performance. Mussels were acclimated to either submerged conditions or a tidal cycle that included either predictable, unpredictable or no thermal stress during daytime low tide. Physiological performance was measured through anaerobic metabolism, energy stores and cellular stress mechanisms just before low tide, and cardiac responses during a thermal ramp. Both air exposure and stochasticity of temperature change were important in determining thermal performance. Glycogen content was highest in the mussels from the unpredictable treatment, but there was no difference in the expression of heat shock proteins between thermal treatments, suggesting that mussels prioritise energy reserves to deal with unpredictable low tide conditions. Mussels exposed to fluctuating thermal regimes had lower gill anaerobic metabolism, which could reflect increased metabolic capacity. Our results suggest that although thermal magnitude plays an important role in shaping physiological performance, other key elements of the intertidal environment complexity such as stochasticity, thermal variability and thermal history are also important considerations for determining how species will respond to climate warming.},

This review summarizes the latest physical and statistical understanding of marine heatwaves based on how they are identified, defined, characterized, and monitored through remotely sensed and in situ data sets. We describe the physical mechanisms that cause marine heatwaves, along with their global distribution, variability, and trends. Finally, we discuss current issues in this developing research area, including considerations related to thechoice of climatological baseline periods in defining extremes and how to communicate findings in the context of societal needs.},

Many locations broke all-time maximum temperature records by more than 5 °C, and the Canadian national temperature record was broken by 4.6 °C, with a new record temperature of 49.6 °C. Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of this event and its impacts. Upstream diabatic heating played a key role in the magnitude of this anomaly. Weather forecasts provided advanced notice of the event, while sub-seasonal forecasts showed an increased likelihood of a heat extreme with lead times of 10-20 days. The impacts of this event were catastrophic, including hundreds of attributable deaths across the Pacific Northwest, mass-mortalities of marine life, reduced crop and fruit yields, river flooding from rapid snow and glacier melt, and a substantial increase in wildfires—the latter contributing to landslides in the months following. These impacts provide examples we can learn from and a vivid depiction of how climate change can be so devastating.},

Four SST peaks were identified during its evolution, which appeared in November 2019, April, July, and November 2020. Positive temperature anomalies were mostly located within the mixed layer for the first-year winter peak. However, the warm core was centered around 50 m below (at the bottom of) the mixed layer for the summer (second-year winter) peak. The dominant factor for the two wintertime peaks was a surface heat flux anomaly, with reduction in evaporative cooling due to the easterly anomaly. The heat flux and potentially the vertical entrainment combined to induce the peak in spring. In the tropical Pacific, a La Niña event occurred following this MHW, while other recorded double-peak events were associated with El Niño or neutral conditions.},

Diploid and triploid oysters were exposed to cultured A. minutum and compared to control diploid and triploid oysters fed T. Isochrysis. Experiments were repeated twice, in April and mid-May 2007, to investigate effects of maturation stage on oyster responses to A. minutum exposure. Oyster maturation stage, Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) accumulation, as well as several digestive gland and hematological variables, were assessed at the ends of the exposures. In both experiments, triploid oysters accumulated more PSTs (approximately twice) than diploid oysters. Significant differences, in terms of phenoloxidase activity (PO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of hemocytes, were observed between A. minutum-exposed and non-exposed oysters. PO in hemocytes was lower in oysters exposed to A. minutum than in control oysters in an early maturation stage (diploids and triploids in April experiment and triploids in May experiment), but this contrast was reversed in ripe oysters (diploids in May experiment). In the April experiment, granulocytes of oysters exposed to A. minutum produced more ROS than those of control oysters; however, in the May experiment, ROS production of granulocytes was lower in A. minutum-exposed oysters. Moreover, significant decreases in free fatty acid, monoacylglycerol, and diacylglycerol contents in digestive glands of oysters exposed to A. minutum were observed. Concurrently, the ratio of reserve lipids (triacylglycerol, ether glycerides and sterol esters) to structural lipids (sterols) decreased upon A. minutum exposure in both experiments. Also, several physiological responses to A. minutum exposure appeared to be modulated by maturation stage as well as ploidy of the oysters.},

In diploid oysters, food deprivation during preconditioning led to reduced gonia proliferation as demonstrated by lower PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) expression and subsequently, the reproductive effort was significantly reduced. For triploid animals exhibiting arrested gametogenesis, dietary conditions impacted the ratio of α (animals with unlocked gametogenesis) and β (animals with locked gametogenesis). Thermal stress applied to these conditioned animals confirmed the weakness of diploid animals with high stored reserves and intense reproductive effort, versus low reproductive effort. Moreover, only low mortalities were observed for triploid animals whatever the reproductive status.

Triploid and diploid spat were planted in the field and, 1 yr later, sampled during the reproductive period.

Triploids grew linearly through the period of reproduction, whereas diploids grew little until spawning when weight decreased by 64\%; growth of diploids and triploids was parallel subsequently. Diploids showed a typical pattern of glycogen utilization, reaching a low of 4.8\% glycogen as dry weight prior to spawning and increasing thereafter. Glycogen levels in triploids also declined, but at a slower rate; glycogen in triploids continued to decline for 2 months after the diploid nadir. Triploids had higher survival rates than diploids, but this is probably not a consequence of reduced sexual maturation. Partial reproductive sterility observed in triploid oysters greatly affects reproductive physiology.

	abstract = {Around 34 years ago, the first reports on the performance of triploid oysters were published. Since then, triploid oysters have offered many benefits to the oyster industry, such as faster growth, improved meat quality, partial sterility, and increased survival due to disease resistance. However, the extent of a triploid growth advantage, in particular, can vary across studies, measurement parameters, environmental conditions and husbandry practices. To quantitatively compare diploid and triploid oyster growth rates, a meta-analysis was performed with 29 published studies using triploid oysters produced by chemical induction or by crossing diploid and tetraploid oysters (i.e., “mated triploids”). The difference in growth rate between ploidy was evaluated using natural log transformed response ratios (ln[3n/2n]) in a random-effects model weighted by sample size. The positive response ratios in 126 of the 148 independent experiments showed a significant growth advantage of the triploid over the diploid. On average, mated triploids grew 20\% faster than diploids in shell height and 49\% faster in whole wet weight. While chemically induced triploids had marginally less growth advantage than mated triploids, growing on average 8\% faster than diploids in shell height and 31\% faster in whole wet weight. Response ratios for experiments using mated triploids and measuring whole wet weight was significantly affected by species and length of study, while response ratios for experiments using chemically induced triploids and measuring whole wet weight was significantly affected by initial size at deployment. Conversely, response ratios for experiments using mated triploids or chemically induced triploids and measuring shell height were not affected by any tested moderator. The lack of a triploid growth advantage in 15\% of the experiments (22/148) could have been influenced by a variety of factors including intraspecific variation, differences in sampling, husbandry practices, and environmental conditions.},

Triploidy was induced using cytochalasin B, and image analysis of biopsied tissue employed to ensure similar ploidy of all animals within each class. Results indicate that lifetime growth in total dry tissue weight over 15 months was more than 60\% faster (p{\textless}0.001) in meiosis I triploids than in diploid siblings or meiosis II triploids, with no difference between meiosis II triploids and their diploid siblings. For six polymorphic enzyme loci, single-locus heterozygosity was consistently greatest in meiosis I triploids (p{\textless}0.001), so that average multiple-locus heterozygosity in meiosis I triploids was 49\% higher than in normal diploids, and 55\% higher than in meiosis II triploids (p{\textless}0.001). This suggests that faster growth resulted from increased allelic diversity, rather than the increased allelic quantity that results from the addition of one entire set of chromosomes among triploids generally. Results also confirm that the faster growth of meiosis I triploids resulted from reduced energy expenditure, associated with lower concentrations of RNA per unit total tissue protein, which infer reduced rates of whole-body protein turnover. Statistical analyses confirmed that differences in oxygen consumption and growth were associated with both ploidy class and average multiple-locus heterozygosity, indicating that performance in meiosis I triploids is not only improved as a result of reduced reproductive output, but also through the metabolic consequences associated with increased heterozygosity.},

In the present study, the expression profiles of mRNA transcripts in the haemocytes of oysters under heat stress were examined to reveal the possible mechanism of heat stress response. There were 23,315, 23,904, 23,123 and 23,672 transcripts identified in the haemocytes of oysters cultured at 25 °C for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h (designed as B, H6, H12, H24), respectively. And 22,330 differentially expressed transcripts (DTs) were yielded in the pairwise comparisons between the above four samples, which corresponded to 8074 genes. There were 9, 12 and 22 Gene Ontology (GO) terms identified in the DT pairwise comparison groups of H6\_B, H12\_H6 and H24\_H12, respectively, and the richest GO terms in biological process category were cellular catabolic process, translational initiation and apoptotic process, respectively. There were 108, 102 and 102 KEGG pathways successfully retrieved from DTs comparison groups DTH6\_B, DTH12\_H6 and DTH24\_H12, respectively, among which 93 pathways were shared by all three comparison groups, and most of them were related to metabolism of protein, carbohydrate and fat. The expression patterns of 12 representative heat stress response-relevant genes detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were similar to those obtained from transcriptome analysis. By flow cytometric analysis, the apoptosis rate of haemocytes increased significantly after oysters were treated at 25 °C for 24 h and recovered at 4 °C for 12 h (p {\textless} 0.05) and 36 h (p {\textless} 0.01), and it also increased significantly when the heat treatment lasted to 60 h (p {\textless} 0.01). The present results indicated that, when oysters encountered short term heat stress, the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, as well as unfolded protein response (UPR) and anti-apoptotic system, were firstly regulated to maintain basic life activities, and then a large number of genes involved in stabilizing protein conformation and facilitating further protein refolding were activated to repair the stress injury. However, the stress injury gradually became irreparable with the stress persisting, and apoptosis was activated when the heat treatment prolonged to 24 h. The information was useful to better understand the molecular mechanism of heat stress response and develop strategies for the improvement of oyster survival rate during summer high-temperature period.},

RNA-seq identified differentially expressed stress responsive transcripts upon thermal stress in the gill tissues of C. gigas. The primary effect of heat stress appears to be significantly induced transcription of molecular chaperones, including members of the heat shock protein (hsp) families, while genes typically associated with protein metabolism, such as those involved in protein degradation (e.g. ATP-dependent proteolysis pathway) and biosynthesis (e.g. ribosomal protein genes), were repressed. In particular, several hsp70 isoforms and a small hsp20 maintained prolonged mRNA expressions for 72h. This study provides preliminary insights into the molecular response of C. gigas to heat stress and suggests a basis for future studies examining molecular adaptation or thermotolerance metabolism in the Pacific oyster.},

	abstract = {Mass mortality is often observed in cultured oysters during the period following spawning in the summer season. To examine the underlying causes leading to this phenomenon, thermotolerance of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was assessed using pre- and postspawning oysters that were sequentially treated with sublethal (37°C) and lethal heat shocks (44°C). The effects were examined on a range of immune and metabolic parameters in addition to mortality rate. A preventative 37°C significantly reduced oyster mortality after exposure to a second heat shock of 44°C, but in postspawning oysters mortality remained at 80\%, compared with {\textless} 10\% in prespawning oysters. Levels of the 72 kDa and 69 kDa heat shock proteins were low in the gill tissue from postspawning oysters stimulated by heat shock, indicating spawning reduced heat shock protein synthesis. The postspawning oysters had depleted glycogen stores in the mantle tissue and reduced adenylate energy charge after heat shock, indicative of lower energy for metabolic activity. A cumulative effect of spawning and heat shock was observed on the immunocompetence of oysters, demonstrated by reduced hemocyte phagocytosis and hemolymph antimicrobial activity. These results support the hypothesis that the energy expended during reproduction compromises the thermotolerance and immune status of oysters, leaving them easily subject to mortality if heat stress occurs in postspawning stage. This study improves our understanding of oyster summer mortality and has implications for the long-term persistence of mollusks under the influence of global warming.},

Synthesis of these three proteins in gills (ctenidia) of C. gigas was reduced to control levels within 2days after SHS as judged by 14C-amino acid incorporation. However, western blotting showed that the levels of these stress proteins in tissues from heat shocked C. gigas remained higher than those in controls, suggesting a reduction in protein degradation after SHS. Variable patterns of these three isoforms were detected in gills, mantle, adductor muscle and digestive gland before and after SHS. The general features described for C. gigas tissues were also observed in adductor muscle, gill and mantle of C. virginica, although some differences were also noted.

We demonstrate that the thermal limits of oysters are relatively plastic, and that these limits are correlated with changes in the expression of one family of heat-shock proteins (HSP70). Oysters were cultured in the intertidal zone, at two tidal heights, and monitored for changes in expression of cognate (HSC) and inducible (HSP) heat-shock proteins during the progression from spring through winter. We found that the “control” levels (i.e., prior to laboratory heat shock) of HSC77 and HSC72 are positively correlated with increases in ambient temperature and were significantly higher in August than in January. The elevated level of HSCs during the summer was associated with moderate, 2–3 °C, increases in the upper thermal limits for survival. We measured concomitant increases in the threshold temperatures (Ton) required for induction of HSP70. Total hsp70 mRNA expression reflected the seasonal changes in the expression of inducible but not cognate members of the HSP70 family of proteins. A potential cost of increased Ton in the summer is that there was no extension of the upper thermal limits for survival (i.e., induction of thermotolerance) after sublethal heat shock at temperatures that were sufficient to induce thermotolerance during the winter months.},

	abstract = {Background
The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is an important marine fishery resource, which contains high levels of glycogen that contributes to the flavor and the quality of the oyster. However, little is known about the molecular and chemical mechanisms underlying glycogen content differences in Pacific oysters. Using a homogeneous cultured Pacific oyster family, we explored these regulatory networks at the level of the metabolome and the transcriptome.

Results
Oysters with the highest and lowest natural glycogen content were selected for differential transcriptome and metabolome analysis. We identified 1888 differentially-expressed genes, seventy-five differentially-abundant metabolites, which are part of twenty-seven signaling pathways that were enriched using an integrated analysis of the interaction between the differentially-expressed genes and the differentially-abundant metabolites. Based on these results, we found that a high expression of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), indicative of increased fatty acid degradation, is associated with a lower glycogen content. Together, a high level of expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and high levels of glucogenic amino acids likely underlie the increased glycogen production in high-glycogen oysters. In addition, the higher levels of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), as well as of the TCA cycle enzymes malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PYC), imply that there is a concomitant up-regulation of energy metabolism in high-glycogen oysters. High-glycogen oysters also appeared to have an increased ability to cope with stress, since the levels of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase enzyme 5 (GPX5) gene were also increased.

Conclusion
Our results suggest that amino acids and free fatty acids are closely related to glycogen content in oysters. In addition, oysters with a high glycogen content have a greater energy production capacity and a greater ability to cope with stress. These findings will not only provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying oyster quality, but also promote research into the molecular breeding of oysters.

The variations in upper thermal limits (LT$_{\textrm{50}}$) under acute heat shock and cardiac activity, standard metabolic rate (SMR), anaerobic metabolite production and molecular responses (expression of molecular chaperones and glycolysis metabolism genes) under increasing temperatures in two oyster subspecies were studied. The populations of two oyster subspecies, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Crassostrea gigas gigas{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. gigas angulata{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, exhibit different latitudinal distributions along the northern and southern coastlines of China, respectively, which experience different environmental conditions. The LT$_{\textrm{50}}$ was significantly higher, by ∼1°C, in the southern than in the northern oysters. In both subspecies, temperature increases had powerful effects on heart rate, SMR and gene expression. The southern oysters had the highest Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures for heart rate (31.4 ± 0.17°C) and SMR (33.09°C), whereas the heart rate (28.86 ± 0.3°C) and SMR (29.22°C) of the northern oysters were lower. The same patterns were observed for the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{10}}$ coefficients. More thermal sensitivity was observed in the northern oysters than in their southern counterparts, as the heat-shock proteins (HSPs) in the northern oysters were expressed first and had a higher induction at a lower temperature than those of southern oysters. Furthermore, different expression patterns of energetic metabolism genes ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}HK, PK{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}PEPCK{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) were observed. In the northern oysters, increasing anaerobic glycolysis genes ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}PEPCK{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) and end products (succinate) were found at 36–43°C, indicating a transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism and a lower aerobic scope compared with the southern oysters. These two subspecies experience different environmental conditions, and their physiological performances suggested species-specific thermal tolerance windows in which the southern oysters, with mild physiological flexibility, had a higher potential capability to withstand heat stress. Overall, our results indicate that comparing and unifying physiological and molecular mechanisms can provide a framework for understanding the likely effects of global warming on marine ectotherms in intertidal regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recently there has been increasing reports about the prevalence of C. gigas as biofouling organism in cooling water systems. In the absence of relevant data on the susceptibility of oysters to commonly employed antifouling techniques such as heat treatment, it was presumed that oysters would be controlled by treatment programmes directed against other major fouling organisms. The present study was carried out to test the above hypothesis, and results showed that C. gigas has an upper temperature tolerance that is much higher than other major marine fouling animals including blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Apparently, temperature regimes presently used in heat treatment of cooling water systems fouled by mussels need to be increased, if C. gigas are to be controlled effectively. Our results also indicate that previous exposure of C. gigas to sublethal high temperatures could make them more resistant to subsequent thermal treatment, an aspect that should be taken into account when heat treatment is used as a fouling control option against oyster fouling.},

They regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level through complementary base pairing with the target mRNA, leading to mRNA degradation and therefore blocking translation. In the last decade, the dysfunction of miRNAs has been related to the development and progression of many diseases. Currently, researchers need a method to identify precisely the miRNA targets, prior to applying experimental approaches that allow a better functional characterization of miRNAs in biological processes and can thus predict their effects. Computational prediction tools provide a rapid method to identify putative miRNA targets. However, since a large number of tools for the prediction of miRNA:mRNA interactions have been developed, all with different algorithms, the biological researcher sometimes does not know which is the best choice for his study and many times does not understand the bioinformatic basis of these tools. This review describes the biological fundamentals of these prediction tools, characterizes the main sequence-based algorithms, and offers some insights into their uses by biologists.},

	abstract = {The human genome encodes for over 1800 microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short non-coding RNA molecules that function to regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Due to the potential for one miRNA to target multiple gene transcripts, miRNAs are recognized as a major mechanism to regulate gene expression and mRNA translation. Computational prediction of miRNA targets is a critical initial step in identifying miRNA:mRNA target interactions for experimental validation. The available tools for miRNA target prediction encompass a range of different computational approaches, from the modeling of physical interactions to the incorporation of machine learning. This review provides an overview of the major computational approaches to miRNA target prediction. Our discussion highlights three tools for their ease of use, reliance on relatively updated versions of miRBase, and range of capabilities, and these are DIANA-microT-CDS, miRanda-mirSVR, and TargetScan. In comparison across all miRNA target prediction tools, four main aspects of the miRNA:mRNA target interaction emerge as common features on which most target prediction is based: seed match, conservation, free energy, and site accessibility. This review explains these features and identifies how they are incorporated into currently available target prediction tools. MiRNA target prediction is a dynamic field with increasing attention on development of new analysis tools. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive assessment of these tools in a manner that is accessible across disciplines. Understanding the basis of these prediction methodologies will aid in user selection of the appropriate tools and interpretation of the tool output.},

	abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. These small regulatory molecules play a key role in the majority of biological processes and their expression is also tightly regulated. Both the deregulation of genes controlled by miRNAs and the altered miRNA expression have been linked to many disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is of particular interest to reliably predict potential miRNA targets which might be involved in these diseases. However, interactions between miRNAs and their targets are complex and very often there are numerous putative miRNA recognition sites in mRNAs. Many miRNA targets have been computationally predicted but only a limited number of these were experimentally validated. Although a variety of miRNA target prediction algorithms are available, results of their application are often inconsistent. Hence, finding a functional miRNA target is still a challenging task. In this review, currently available and frequently used computational tools for miRNA target prediction, i.e., PicTar, TargetScan, DIANA-microT, miRanda, rna22 and PITA are outlined and various practical aspects of miRNA target analysis are extensively discussed. Moreover, the performance of three algorithms (PicTar, TargetScan and DIANA-microT) is both demonstrated and evaluated by performing an in-depth analysis of miRNA interactions with mRNAs derived from genes triggering hereditary neurological disorders known as trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs), such as Huntington’s disease (HD), a number of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 19 to 25 nucleotides non-coding RNAs known to possess important post-transcriptional regulatory functions. Identifying targeting genes that miRNAs regulate are important for understanding their specific biological functions. Usually, miRNAs down-regulate target genes through binding to the complementary sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the targets. In part, due to the large number of miRNAs and potential targets, an experimental based prediction design would be extremely laborious and economically unfavorable. However, since the bindings of the animal miRNAs are not a perfect one-to-one match with the complementary sites of their targets, it is difficult to predict targets of animal miRNAs by accessing their alignment to the 3' UTRs of potential targets. Consequently, sophisticated computational approaches for miRNA target prediction are being considered as essential methods in miRNA research., We surveyed most of the current computational miRNA target prediction algorithms in this paper. Particularly, we provided a mathematical definition and formulated the problem of target prediction under the framework of statistical classification. Moreover, we summarized the features of miRNA-target pairs in target prediction approaches and discussed these approaches according to two categories, which are the rule-based and the data-driven approaches. The rule-based approach derives the classifier mainly on biological prior knowledge and important observations from biological experiments, whereas the data driven approach builds statistic models using the training data and makes predictions based on the models. Finally, we tested a few different algorithms on a set of experimentally validated true miRNA-target pairs [] and a set of false miRNA-target pairs, derived from miRNA overexpression experiment []. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to show the performances of these algorithms.},

While bleaching is a well-recognized threat, the impact on the process of reproduction in bleaching survivors is not well resolved, despite being central to coral resilience. Montipora capitata can survive bleaching while completing a full gametogenic cycle, offering an ideal system to study gametogenic resilience and physiological tradeoffs. We experimentally bleached fragments of M. capitata colonies and followed their gametogenesis and physiological responses for 10 months (six time points). All bleached colonies produced gametes at the same time as controls, suggesting that reproductive processes were energetically prioritized. However, proteomic analysis revealed tradeoffs and delays in activating key physiological processes earlier in gametogenesis in areas such as skeletal growth and reproductive hormone synthesis. Tradeoffs during the gametogenic cycle, likely a direct response to thermal bleaching, resulted in smaller oocytes from bleached colonies, potentially indicating decreased transfer of parental resources to gametes. While gametogenesis is likely to continue in this species, it is unknown how the viability and success of future offspring may be impacted by future bleaching events.},

	abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have become more frequent, intense and extreme in oceanic systems in the past decade, resulting in mass mortality events of marine invertebrates and devastating coastal marine ecosystems. While metabolic homeostasis is a fundamental requirement in stress tolerance, little is known about its role under intensifying MHWs conditions. Here, we investigated impacts of MHWs on the metabolism in pearl oysters (Pinctada maxima) – an ecologically and economically significant bivalve species in tropical ecosystems. Activities of digestive enzymes (gastric proteases, lipases, and amylases) did not significantly respond to various scenario of recurrent MHWs varying from 24 °C to 28 °C (moderate) and 32 °C (severe). The metabolomics analysis revealed nine and five key metabolism pathways under both MHWs scenarios. Specifically, pathways associated with energy metabolism were impaired by moderate MHWs, manifesting in downregulation of differential metabolite (The nicotinic acid and N-acetyl-glutamic acid). The content of CDP-ethanolamine was significantly decrease, and the perturbations of oxidative stress caused by the decreased of content of D-glutamine. Metabolites related to a suite of body functions (e.g., the lipid metabolism, biomineralization, and antioxidant defenses) showed significantly negative responses by severe MHWs. These findings reveal the metabolic impairments of marine bivalves when subjected to MHWs varying in intensity and frequency, implying cascading consequences which deserve further investigation.},

	abstract = {Crassostrea gigas is a frequently studied species in understanding physiological processes in bivalves. Similar to other animals, oysters store glucose in the body as glycogen. Glycogen is known to supply energy for germ cell development and maintenance. Glycogen is synthesized by glycogen synthase. GSK3β regulates glycogen synthase activity and plays an important role in glycogen synthesis. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of GSK3β on the annual cycle of oysters and the glycogen synthesis pathway and to investigate the energy pathway in comparison with seasonal variation. Oysters were sampled monthly for one year and were subjected to glycogen content, RT-PCR, FISH, and western blot analysis. The year-round glycogen content significantly differs only in the mantle edge during spring and summer of both sexes but not in labial palp, digestive gland, gonad, and adductor muscle. The expression of GSK3β mRNA level was highest in October for females and April for males. Both sexes had the lowest expression in July. In the adductor muscle, females and males showed the highest expression in April and the lowest in July and October. The pattern of GSK3β expression in gonads and adductor muscle was similarly confirmed through FISH. As a result of examining the signaling system, p-GSK3β (serine 9) increased. At the same time, glycogen synthase decreased in May when the condition index was the highest, pGSK3β decreased in October and July when spawning occurred, and glycogen synthase increased. Overall, it is thought that p-GSK3β expression is high in C. gigas at ripe, which inhibits glycogen synthesis and is used as energy for growth and maturation. Glycogen synthesis occurs for energy storage during degeneration.},

Polyunsaturated fatty acids were the most abundant type of lipids in oysters, ranging from 41.66\% to 53.36\%. We identified six lipid classes in Pacific oysters, with the three dominant classes being PoL, ST, and TG, which exhibited significant variation, with the highest variability observed in May and June and the lowest in July.

By contrast, bilaterian miRNA targets are largely not conserved. Cnidaria is the sister group to Bilateria and thus provides a unique opportunity for comparative studies. Strikingly, like their plant counterparts, cnidarian miRNAs have been shown to predominantly have highly complementary targets leading to transcript cleavage by Argonaute proteins. Here, we assess the conservation of miRNAs and their targets by small RNA sequencing followed by miRNA target prediction in eight species of Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals), the earliest-branching cnidarian class. We uncover dozens of novel miRNAs but only a few conserved ones. Further, given their high complementarity, we were able to computationally identify miRNA targets in each species. Besides evidence for conservation of specific miRNA target sites, which are maintained between sea anemones and stony corals across 500 Myr of evolution, we also find indications for convergent evolution of target regulation by different miRNAs. Our data indicate that cnidarians have only few conserved miRNAs and corresponding targets, despite their high complementarity, suggesting a high evolutionary turnover.},

	abstract = {Octocorals are a major component of the sessile benthic fauna worldwide, especially important in tropical regions, such as the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean, where together with hard corals they represent the most common group of macrobenthic animals of coral reefs. Despite their importance, little is known about their physiology, specifically the importance of their symbiotic relationship with the algal endosymbiont from the genus Symbiodinium, and the advantages/disadvantages associated with this symbiosis. In symbiotic species, the energetic contribution from Symbiodinium to the host might increase their resistance and/or recovery from stressful conditions, but the presence of these algal endosymbionts also limits octocoral distribution to the photic zone, where light is available. During the past few decades, octocorals have gained dominance in some tropical areas where scleractinian corals have declined due to climate change and local perturbations, increasing the need for research related to this understudied group. This chapter summarizes the current knowledge available about the ecology and physiology of octocorals, focusing on differences that are the result of the presence or absence of endosymbionts, and discusses the implications of having endosymbionts in the context of how octocorals may respond to global climate change.

	abstract = {Octocorals are one of the most ubiquitous benthic organisms in marine ecosystems from the shallow tropics to the Antarctic deep sea, providing habitat for numerous organisms as well as ecosystem services for humans. In contrast to the holobionts of reef-building scleractinian corals, the holobionts of octocorals have received relatively little attention, despite the devastating effects of disease outbreaks on many populations. Recent advances have shown that octocorals possess remarkably stable bacterial communities on geographical and temporal scales as well as under environmental stress. This may be the result of their high capacity to regulate their microbiome through the production of antimicrobial and quorum-sensing interfering compounds. Despite decades of research relating to octocoral-microbe interactions, a synthesis of this expanding field has not been conducted to date. We therefore provide an urgently needed review on our current knowledge about octocoral holobionts. Specifically, we briefly introduce the ecological role of octocorals and the concept of holobiont before providing detailed overviews of (I) the symbiosis between octocorals and the algal symbiont Symbiodinium; (II) the main fungal, viral, and bacterial taxa associated with octocorals; (III) the dominance of the microbial assemblages by a few microbial species, the stability of these associations, and their evolutionary history with the host organism; (IV) octocoral diseases; (V) how octocorals use their immune system to fight pathogens; (VI) microbiome regulation by the octocoral and its associated microbes; and (VII) the discovery of natural products with microbiome regulatory activities. Finally, we present our perspectives on how the field of octocoral research should move forward, and the recognition that these organisms may be suitable model organisms to study coral-microbe symbioses.},

Among the greatest of changes in our biosphere within the last century is rapid anthropogenic ocean warming. This phenomenon threatens corals with extinction, evidenced by the increasing observation of widespread mortality following mass bleaching events. There is some evidence and conjecture that coral-dinoflagellate symbioses change partnerships in response to changing external conditions over ecological and evolutionary timescales. Until now, we have been unable to ascertain the genetic identity of Symbiodinium hosted by corals prior to the rapid global change of the last century. Here, we show that Symbiodinium cells recovered from dry, century old specimens of 6 host species of octocorals contain sufficient DNA for amplification of the ITS2 subregion of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, commonly used for genotyping within this genus. Through comparisons with modern specimens sampled from similar locales we show that symbiotic associations among several species have been static over the last century, thereby suggesting that adaptive shifts to novel symbiont types is not common among these gorgonians, and perhaps, symbiotic corals in general.},

Recent work demonstrates that it is possible to characterize epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation in well preserved ancient tissues. This approach has not yet been tested in traditionally prepared natural history specimens such as dried bones and skins, the most common specimen types in vertebrate collections. In this study, we developed and tested methods to characterize cytosine methylation in dried skulls up to 76 years old. Using a combination of ddRAD and bisulphite treatment, we characterized patterns of cytosine methylation in two species of deer mouse (Peromyscus spp.) collected in the same region in Michigan in 1940, 2003, and 2013–2016. We successfully estimated methylation in specimens of all age groups, although older specimens yielded less data and showed greater interindividual variation in data yield than newer specimens. Global methylation estimates were reduced in the oldest specimens (76 years old) relative to the newest specimens (1–3 years old), which may reflect post-mortem hydrolytic deamination. Methylation was reduced in promoter regions relative to gene bodies and showed greater bimodality in autosomes relative to female X chromosomes, consistent with expectations for methylation in mammalian somatic cells. Our work demonstrates the utility of historic specimens for methylation analyses, as with genomic analyses; however, studies will need to accommodate the large variance in the quantity of data produced by older specimens.},

Increased epigenetic diversity has been hypothesized to facilitate adaptation and population persistence via non-genetic phenotypic variation, especially if there is reduced genetic diversity when populations expand (i.e., epigenetic diversity compensates for low genetic diversity). In this study, we use the spatial distribution of genetic and epigenetic diversity to test this hypothesis in populations of the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) sampled across a purported recent range expansion gradient. We found mixed support for the epigenetic compensation hypothesis and a lack of support for expectations for expansion populations of mice at the range edge, which likely reflects a complex history of expansion in white-footed mice in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Specifically, epigenetic diversity was not increased in the population at the purported edge of the range expansion in comparison to the other expansion populations. However, input from an additional ancestral source populations may have increased genetic diversity at this range edge population, counteracting the expected genetic consequences of expansion, as well as reducing the benefit of increased epigenetic diversity at the range edge. Future work will expand the focal populations to include expansion areas with a single founding lineage to test for the robustness of a general trend that supports the hypothesized compensation of reduced genetic diversity by epigenetic variation observed in the expansion population that was founded from a single historical source.},

In particular, we need efficient yet cost-effective ways to measure CpG methylation states over large and complete regions of the genome. Here, we develop TEEM-Seq (target-enriched enzymatic methyl sequencing), a method that combines enzymatic methyl sequencing with a custom-designed hybridization capture bait set that can be scaled to reactions including large numbers of samples in any species for which a reference genome is available. Using DNA from a passerine bird, the superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus), we show that TEEM-Seq is able to quantify DNA methylation states similarly well to the more traditional approaches of whole-genome and reduced-representation sequencing. Moreover, we demonstrate its reliability and repeatability, as duplicate libraries from the same samples were highly correlated. Importantly, the downstream bioinformatic analysis for TEEM-Seq is the same as for any sequence-based approach to studying DNA methylation, making it simple to incorporate into a variety of workflows. We believe that TEEM-Seq could replace traditional approaches for studying DNA methylation in candidate genes and pathways, and be effectively paired with other whole-genome or reduced-representation sequencing approaches to increase project sample sizes. In addition, TEEM-Seq can be combined with mRNA sequencing to examine how DNA methylation in promoters or other regulatory regions is related to the expression of individual genes or gene networks. By maximizing the number of samples in the hybridization reaction, TEEM-Seq is an inexpensive and flexible sequence-based approach for quantifying DNA methylation in species where other capture-based methods are unavailable or too expensive, particularly for non-model organisms.},

The standard method for assaying DNA methylation (whole genome bisulphite sequencing), however, is currently too costly to apply at the scales required for ecological research. Here, we evaluate different methods for measuring DNA methylation for ecological epigenetics. We compare whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) with methylated CpG binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq), and a modified version of MethylRAD we term methylation-dependent restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (mdRAD). We evaluate these three assays in measuring variation in methylation across the genome, between genotypes, and between polyp types in the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. We find that all three assays measure absolute methylation levels similarly for gene bodies (gbM), as well as exons and 1 Kb windows with a minimum Pearson correlation 0.66. Differential gbM estimates were less correlated, but still concurrent across assays. We conclude that MBD-seq and mdRAD are reliable and cost-effective alternatives to WGBS. The considerably lower sequencing effort required for mdRAD to produce comparable methylation estimates makes it particularly useful for ecological epigenetics.},

Acclimatory mechanisms may be especially crucial for sessile benthic marine taxa, such as reef-building corals, where climate change factors including ocean acidification and increasing temperature elicit strong negative physiological responses such as bleaching, disease and mortality. Here, within the context of multiple stressors threatening marine organisms, I describe the wealth of metaorganism response mechanisms to rapid ocean change and the ontogenetic shifts in organism interactions with the environment that can generate plasticity. I then highlight the need to consider the interactions of rapid and evolutionary responses in an adaptive (epi)genetic continuum. Building on the definitions of these mechanisms and continuum, I also present how the interplay of the microbiome, epigenetics and parental effects creates additional avenues for rapid acclimatization. To consider under what conditions epigenetic inheritance has a more substantial role, I propose investigation into the offset of timing of gametogenesis leading to different environmental integration times between eggs and sperm and the consequences of this for gamete epigenetic compatibility. Collectively, non-genetic, yet heritable phenotypic plasticity will have significant ecological and evolutionary implications for sessile marine organism persistence under rapid climate change. As such, reef-building corals present ideal and time-sensitive models for further development of our understanding of adaptive feedback loops in a multi-player (epi)genetic continuum.},

However, previous studies have been limited to in silico analyses or characterization of DNA methylation at the single gene level. Here, we have employed a genome-wide approach to gain insight into how DNA methylation supports the regulation of the genome in C. gigas. Using a combination of methylation enrichment and high-throughput bisulfite sequencing, we have been able to map methylation at over 2.5 million individual CpG loci. This is the first high-resolution methylome generated for a molluscan species. Results indicate that methylation varies spatially across the genome with a majority of the methylated sites mapping to intra genic regions. The bisulfite sequencing data was combined with RNA-seq data to examine genome-wide relationships between gene body methylation and gene expression, where it was shown that methylated genes are associated with high transcript abundance and low variation in expression between tissue types. The combined data suggest DNA methylation plays a complex role in regulating genome activity in bivalves.},

The occurrence of gbM within protein-coding sequences is particularly puzzling, because methylation causes cytosine hypermutability and hence is likely to produce deleterious amino acid substitutions. We investigate this enigma using an evolutionarily basal group of Metazoa, the stony corals (order Scleractinia, class Anthozoa, phylum Cnidaria). We show that patterns of coral gbM are similar to other invertebrate species, predicting wide and active transcription and slower sequence evolution. We also find a strong correlation between gbM and codon bias, resulting from systematic replacement of CpG bearing codons. We conclude that gbM has strong effects on codon evolution and speculate that this may influence establishment of optimal codons.},

Because it can be influenced by the environment, DNA methylation may contribute to the ability of organisms to acclimatize and adapt to environmental change. We evaluated the distribution of gene body methylation in reef-building corals, a group of organisms facing significant environmental threats. Gene body methylation in six species of corals was inferred from in silico transcriptome analysis of CpG O/E, an estimate of germline DNA methylation that is highly correlated with patterns of methylation enrichment. Consistent with what has been documented in most other invertebrates, all corals exhibited bimodal distributions of germline methylation suggestive of distinct fractions of genes with high and low levels of methylation. The hypermethylated fractions were enriched with genes with housekeeping functions, while genes with inducible functions were highly represented in the hypomethylated fractions. High transcript abundance was associated with intermediate levels of methylation. In three of the coral species, we found that genes differentially expressed in response to thermal stress and ocean acidification exhibited significantly lower levels of methylation. These results support a link between gene body hypomethylation and transcriptional plasticity that may point to a role of DNA methylation in the response of corals to environmental change.},

	abstract = {For sessile organisms at high risk from climate change, phenotypic plasticity can be critical to rapid acclimation. Epigenetic markers like DNA methylation are hypothesized as mediators of plasticity; methylation is associated with the regulation of gene expression, can change in response to ecological cues, and is a proposed basis for the inheritance of acquired traits. Within reef-building corals, gene-body methylation (gbM) can change in response to ecological stressors. If coral DNA methylation is transmissible across generations, this could potentially facilitate rapid acclimation to environmental change. We investigated methylation heritability in Acropora, a stony reef-building coral. Two Acropora millepora and two Acropora selago adults were crossed, producing eight offspring crosses (four hybrid, two of each species). We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to identify methylated loci and allele-specific alignments to quantify per-locus inheritance. If methylation is heritable, differential methylation (DM) between the parents should equal DM between paired offspring alleles at a given locus. We found a mixture of heritable and nonheritable loci, with heritable portions ranging from 44\% to 90\% among crosses. gBM was more heritable than intergenic methylation, and most loci had a consistent degree of heritability between crosses (i.e. the deviation between parental and offspring DM were of similar magnitude and direction). Our results provide evidence that coral methylation can be inherited but that heritability is heterogenous throughout the genome. Future investigations into this heterogeneity and its phenotypic implications will be important to understanding the potential capability of intergenerational environmental acclimation in reef building corals.},

We develop the m(1)A-ID-seq technique, based on m(1)A immunoprecipitation and the inherent ability of m(1)A to stall reverse transcription, as a means for transcriptome-wide m(1)A profiling. m(1)A-ID-seq identifies 901 m(1)A peaks (from 600 genes) in mRNA and noncoding RNA and reveals a prominent feature, enrichment in the 5' untranslated region of mRNA transcripts, that is distinct from the pattern for N(6)-methyladenosine, the most abundant internal mammalian mRNA modification. Moreover, m(1)A in mRNA is reversible by ALKBH3, a known DNA/RNA demethylase. Lastly, we show that m(1)A methylation responds dynamically to stimuli, and we identify hundreds of stress-induced m(1)A sites. Collectively, our approaches allow comprehensive analysis of m(1)A modification and provide tools for functional studies of potential epigenetic regulation via the reversible and dynamic m(1)A methylation.},

Available methods are expensive, laborious and often limited by either the analysis of short CpG stretches or low assay sensitivity. Here, we present a cost-efficient next generation sequencing-based strategy for the simultaneous investigation of multiple candidate genes in large cohorts. To illustrate the method, we present analysis of four candidate genes commonly assessed in psychoneuroendocrine research: Glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), Serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), FKBP Prolyl isomerase 5 (FKBP5), and the Oxytocin receptor (OXTR). DNA methylation standards (100 \%; 75 \%; 50 \%; 25 \% and 0 \%) and DNA of a female and male donor were bisulfite treated in three independent trials and were used to generate sequencing libraries for 42 CpGs from the NR3C1 1 F promoter region, 84 CpGs of the SLC6A4 5′ regulatory region, 5 CpGs located in FKBP5 intron 7, and additional 12 CpGs located in a potential enhancer element in intron 3 of the OXTR. In addition, DNA of 45 patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and 45 healthy controls was assayed. Multiplex libraries of all samples were sequenced on a MiSeq system and analyzed for mean methylation values of all CpG sites using amplikyzer2 software. Results indicated excellent accuracy of the assays when investigating replicates generated from the same bisulfite converted DNA, and very high linearity (R2 {\textgreater} 0.9) of the assays shown by the analysis of differentially methylated DNA standards. Comparing DNA methylation between BPD and healthy controls revealed no biologically relevant differences. The technical approach as described here facilitates targeted DNA methylation analysis and represents a highly sensitive, cost-efficient and high throughput tool to close the gap between coverage and precision in epigenetic research of stress-associated phenotypes.},

RNA editing is the cornerstone of innate immunity that distinguishes between self and non-self (virus), and it is essential for normal regulation of cellular homeostasis. Although much is already known about the role of ADAR proteins in RNA virus infection, the role of ADAR proteins in herpesvirus infection remains largely unexplored. In this review, we provide several lines of evidence from studies of different herpesviruses for another level of complexity in regulating the already intricate biphasic life cycle of herpesviruses.},

Here, we describe data collection for almost 30 years, cleaning and processing. For 13 locations, we modeled growth and mortality of spat (less than one-year-old individuals) and half-grown oysters (between one and two-year-old individuals) as a function of time to cope with changes in data acquisition frequency, and produced standardized annual growth and cumulative mortality indicators to improve data usability. This improved database is expected to be used by ecologists interested in the evolution of life-cycle indicators of a marine species under the influence of climate change.

Here we reviewed 10,090 abstracts and extracted data from 71 studies reported in 58 relevant publications, to assess quantitatively whether phenotypic trait changes associated with climate change are adaptive in animals. A meta-analysis focussing on birds, the taxon best represented in our dataset, suggests that global warming has not systematically affected morphological traits, but has advanced phenological traits. We demonstrate that these advances are adaptive for some species, but imperfect as evidenced by the observed consistent selection for earlier timing. Application of a theoretical model indicates that the evolutionary load imposed by incomplete adaptive responses to ongoing climate change may already be threatening the persistence of species.},

Additionally, adaptive sampling, a software-controlled enrichment method for targeted sequencing, allows reduced representation methylation sequencing that can be applied to CpG islands or imprinted regions. Here we present DeepMod2, a comprehensive deep-learning framework for methylation detection using ionic current signal from Nanopore sequencing. DeepMod2 implements both a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model and a Transformer model and can analyze POD5 and FAST5 signal files generated on R9 and R10 flowcells. Additionally, DeepMod2 can run efficiently on central processing unit (CPU) through model pruning and can infer epihaplotypes or haplotype-specific methylation calls from phased reads. We use multiple publicly available and newly generated datasets to evaluate the performance of DeepMod2 under varying scenarios. DeepMod2 has comparable performance to Guppy and Dorado, which are the current state-of-the-art methods from Oxford Nanopore Technologies that remain closed-source. Moreover, we show a high correlation (r = 0.96) between reduced representation and whole-genome Nanopore sequencing. In summary, DeepMod2 is an open-source tool that enables fast and accurate DNA methylation detection from whole-genome or adaptive sequencing data on a diverse range of flowcell types.},

There is also an enzymatic pathway of cytosine deamination with multiple DNA (cytosine) deaminases involved in this process. In order to describe potential roles of genomic uracil, it is of key importance to utilize efficient uracil-DNA detection methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and critical assessment of currently available uracil detection methods with special focus on genome-wide mapping solutions.

Aberrant CpG island methylation patterns are frequently associated with cancer and thus researching DNA methylation of miRNA genes is a topic of increased research interest. Large quantities of available data from various studies are fragmented and incomplete; therefore, integration was performed. Data from 150 articles revealed 180 miRNA genes shown to be regulated via DNA methylation in 36 cancer types. From the total of  2588 known mature miRNA 6.9\% (180/2588) miRNAs have been shown to be epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. 45.5\% (82/180) of miRNA genes were shown to be methylated in at least two cancer types among them hsa-miR-34b, hsa-miR-34c and hsa-miR-34a were found to be silenced in 24, 21 and 17 cancer types, respectively. The other 54.4\% (98/180) miRNA genes regulated by DNA methylation were found to be specific for a certain type of cancer and therefore represent specific biomarker potential. Because specific miRNAs have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential, the systematically review of the field offers an overview of the field and facilitates experiment planning, generation of more targeted hypotheses and more efficient biomarker and target development.},

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have being discovered as a significant regulator on gene expression at the epigenetic level. Emerging evidences have indicated the intricate regulatory effects between lncRNAs and DNA methylation. On one hand, transcription of lncRNAs are controlled by the promoter methylation, which is similar to protein coding genes, on the other hand, lncRNA could interact with enzymes involved in DNA methylation to affect the methylation pattern of downstream genes, thus regulating their expression. In addition, circular RNAs (circRNAs) being an important class of noncoding RNA are also found to participate in this complex regulatory network. In this review, we summarize recent research progress on this crosstalk between lncRNA, circRNA, and DNA methylation as well as their potential functions in complex diseases including cancer. This work reveals a hidden layer for gene transcriptional regulation and enhances our understanding for epigenetics regarding detailed mechanisms on lncRNA regulatory function in human cancers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The consequence of this binding is generally the degradation of mRNA and the inhibition of its translation. For this reason, miRNAs are included among the epigenetic factors acting as a modulator of gene expression. How miRNAs expression is, in turn, regulated is still the object of active investigation, but DNA methylation, another epigenetic modification, seems to play a central role in this sense. The “one-carbon” metabolism is responsible for the metabolic regulation of trans-methylation reactions and, therefore, DNA methylation. For this reason, to investigate the possible correlations between alterations of the one-carbon metabolism and differential DNA methylation sounds interesting. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that, vice-versa, miRNAs are associated with DNA methylation modulation, in a mutual cross-talk. The present review will discuss the interplay between miRNAs and DNA methylation and its fall-out on gene expression regulation.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the world. Currently, the main treatments for breast cancer are radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and surgery. The treatment measures for breast cancer depend on the molecular subtype. Thus, the exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for breast cancer remains a hotspot in research. In breast cancer, a high level of expression of DNMTs is highly correlated with poor prognosis, that is, the abnormal methylation of tumor suppressor genes usually promotes tumorigenesis and progression. MiRNAs, as non-coding RNAs, have been identified to play key roles in breast cancer. The aberrant methylation of miRNAs could lead to drug resistance during the aforementioned treatment. Therefore, the regulation of miRNA methylation might serve as a therapeutic target in breast cancer. In this paper, we reviewed studies on the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA and DNA methylation in breast cancer from the last decade, focusing on the promoter region of tumor suppressor miRNAs methylated by DNMTs and the highly expressed oncogenic miRNAs inhibited by DNMTs or activating TETs.},

Integral to several physiological processes, their aberrant expression often drives the pathogenesis of both benign and malignant diseases. Similarly, DNA methylation represents an epigenetic modification influencing transcription and playing a critical role in silencing numerous genes. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes through DNA methylation has been reported in many types of cancer and is associated with tumor development and progression. A growing body of literature has described the crosstalk between DNA methylation and miRNAs as an additional layer in the regulation of gene expression. Methylation in miRNA promoter regions inhibits its transcription, while miRNAs can target transcripts and subsequently regulate the proteins responsible for DNA methylation. Such relationships between miRNA and DNA methylation serve an important regulatory role in several tumor types and highlight a novel avenue for potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we discuss the crosstalk between DNA methylation and miRNA expression in the pathogenesis of cancer and describe how miRNAs influence DNA methylation and, conversely, how methylation impacts the expression of miRNAs. Finally, we address how these epigenetic modifications may be leveraged as biomarkers in cancer.},

Extensive studies have been conducted to elucidate the regulatory processes governing DNA methylation and demethylation in both plants and animals under normal and stress conditions. Plants possess specific DNA methyltransferase enzymes that establish and maintain DNA methylation in all sequence contexts (CG, CHH, CHG) within targeted regions of both euchromatin and heterochromatin on the chromosomes. Various epigenetic marks rely on each other and are interconnected for their establishment and maintenance. Long noncoding RNAs regulate genomic organization, chromatin structure, compaction, and genome stability. These noncoding RNAs are categorized by their functions and formations, which display considerable diversity in DNA methylation among different plant species. Transcriptionally, the abundance of noncoding RNA is controlled by various epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation. Due to their participation in several epigenetic and genetic regulatory mechanisms, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may influence developmental processes, stress responses, and adaptability. This review offers a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in understanding the intricate relationship between DNA methylation and noncoding RNAs.

As sessile organisms, plants have evolved sophisticated regulatory systems to endure or respond to diverse adverse abiotic environmental challenges, i.e., abiotic stresses, such as extreme temperatures (cold and heat), drought and salinity. Plant stress responses are often accompanied by changes in chromatin modifications at diverse responsive loci, such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{6}}$-methyladenine (6mA) DNA methylation. Some abiotic stress responses are memorized for several hours or days through mitotic cell divisions and quickly reset to baseline levels after normal conditions are restored, which is referred to as somatic memory. In some cases, stress-induced chromatin marks are meiotically heritable and can impart the memory of stress exposure from parent plants to at least the next stress-free offspring generation through the mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, which may offer the descendants the potential to be adaptive for better fitness. In this review, we briefly summarize recent achievements regarding the establishment, maintenance and reset of DNA methylation, and highlight the diverse roles of DNA methylation in plant responses to abiotic stresses. Further, we discuss the potential role of DNA methylation in abiotic stress-induced somatic memory and transgenerational inheritance.

Gene expression is driven by changes in DNA bases, histone proteins, the biogenesis of ncRNA, and changes in the nucleotide sequence. To cope with abiotic stresses, plants adopt certain changes driven by a sophisticated biological system. DNA methylation is a primary mechanism for epigenetic variation, which can induce phenotypic alterations in plants under stress. Some of the stress-driven changes in plants are temporary, while some modifications may be stable and inheritable to the next generations to allow them to cope with such extreme stress challenges in the future. In this review, we discuss the pivotal role of epigenetically developed phenotypic characteristics in plants as an evolutionary process participating in adaptation and tolerance responses to abiotic and biotic stresses that alter their growth and development. We emphasize the molecular process underlying changes in DNA methylation, differential variation for different species, the roles of non-coding RNAs in epigenetic modification, techniques for studying DNA methylation, and its role in crop improvement in tolerance to abiotic stress (drought, salinity, and heat).

While the precise role of these siRNAs and the methylation they trigger is unclear, they have been implicated in specifying a single megaspore mother cell, silencing transposons in the male germ line, mediating parental dosage conflict to ensure proper endosperm development, hypermethylation of mature embryos, and trans-chromosomal methylation in hybrids.

	abstract = {Drought is the most prevalent environmental stress that affects plants’ growth, development, and crop productivity. However, plants have evolved adaptive mechanisms to respond to the harmful effects of drought. They reprogram their: transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome that alter their cellular and physiological processes and establish cellular homeostasis. One of the crucial regulatory processes that govern this reprogramming is post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, involved in the downregulation of the target mRNA via translation inhibition/mRNA degradation/miRNA-mediated mRNA decay/ribosome drop off/DNA methylation. Many drought-inducible miRNAs have been identified and characterized in plants. Their main targets are regulatory genes that influence growth, development, osmotic stress tolerance, antioxidant defense, phytohormone-mediated signaling, and delayed senescence during drought stress. Overexpression of drought-responsive miRNAs (Osa-miR535, miR160, miR408, Osa-miR393, Osa-miR319, and Gma-miR394) in certain plants has led to tolerance against drought stress indicating their vital role in stress mitigation. Similarly, knock down (miR166/miR398c) or deletion (miR169 and miR827) of miRNAs has also resulted in tolerance to drought stress. Likewise, engineered Arabidopsis plants with miR165, miR166 using short tandem target mimic strategy, exhibited drought tolerance. Since miRNAs regulate the expression of an array of drought-responsive genes, they can act as prospective targets for genetic manipulations to enhance drought tolerance in crops and achieve sustainable agriculture. Further investigations toward functional characterization of diverse miRNAs, and understanding stress-responses regulated by these miRNAs and their utilization in biotechnological applications is highly recommended.},

Discovered 30 years ago in the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode, these small molecules have since cemented their critical roles in regulating virtually all aspects of eukaryotic development. Here, we provide an overview on the current understanding of epigenetic inheritance in animals, including mice and C. elegans, as it pertains to stresses such as temperature, nutritional, and pathogenic encounters. We focus on C. elegans to address the mechanistic complexity of how small RNAs target their cohort mRNAs to effect gene expression and how they govern the propagation or termination of generational perdurance in epigenetic inheritance.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Transitions in gene regulatory processes responsible for the emergence of specialized cell types and spatiotemporal regulation of developmental signaling prior to the divergence of Cnidaria and Bilateria are poorly understood. As a sister group of Bilateria, the phylum Cnidaria can provide significant insights into these processes. Among the cnidarians, hydrae have been studied for \&gt;250 years to comprehend the mechanisms underlying their unique immortality and robust regenerative capacity. Studies on {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Hydra{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} spp. and other pre-bilaterians alike have advanced our understanding of the evolutionary underpinnings governing eumetazoan tissue development, homeostasis, and regeneration. In addition to its regenerative potential, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Hydra{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} exhibits continuously active axial patterning due to its peculiar tissue dynamics. These distinctive physiological processes necessitate large scale gene expression changes that are governed by the multitude of epigenetic mechanisms operating in cells. This review highlights the contemporary knowledge of epigenetic regulation in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Hydra{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} with contemporary studies from other members of Cnidaria, as well as the interplay between regulatory mechanisms wherever demonstrated. The studies covered in the scope of this review reveal both ancestral and divergent roles played by conserved epigenetic mechanisms with emphasis on transcriptional regulation. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics data was mined to predict the physiological relevance of putative gene regulatory components, which is in agreement with published findings and yielded insights into the possible functions of the gene regulatory mechanisms that are yet to be deciphered in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Hydra{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, such as DNA methylation. Finally, we delineate potentially rewarding epigenetics research avenues that can further leverage the unique biology of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Hydra{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent studies emphasize the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the stress responses and adaptations of organisms to those stressors. Epigenetics influences gene expression, enabling phenotypic plasticity and transgenerational effects. Therefore, understanding the epigenetic responses of aquatic invertebrates to environmental stressors is imperative for aquatic ecosystem research. In this study, we organize the mechanisms of epigenetics in aquatic invertebrates and explore their roles in the responses of aquatic invertebrates to environmental stressors. Furthermore, we discuss the inheritance of epigenetic changes and their influence across generations in aquatic invertebrates. A comprehensive understanding of epigenetic responses is crucial for long-term ecosystem management and conservation strategies in the face of irreversible climate change in aquatic environments. In this review, we synthesize existing knowledge about environmental epigenetics in aquatic invertebrates to provide insights and suggest directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Museum genomics has transformed the field of collections-based research, opening up a range of new research directions for paleontological specimens as well as natural history specimens collected over the past few centuries. Recent work demonstrates that it is possible to characterize epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation in well preserved ancient tissues. This approach has not yet been tested in traditionally prepared natural history specimens such as dried bones and skins, the most common specimen types in vertebrate collections. In this study, we developed and tested methods to characterize cytosine methylation in dried skulls up to 76 years old. Using a combination of ddRAD and bisulphite treatment, we characterized patterns of cytosine methylation in two species of deer mouse (Peromyscus spp.) collected in the same region in Michigan in 1940, 2003, and 2013–2016. We successfully estimated methylation in specimens of all age groups, although older specimens yielded less data and showed greater interindividual variation in data yield than newer specimens. Global methylation estimates were reduced in the oldest specimens (76 years old) relative to the newest specimens (1–3 years old), which may reflect post-mortem hydrolytic deamination. Methylation was reduced in promoter regions relative to gene bodies and showed greater bimodality in autosomes relative to female X chromosomes, consistent with expectations for methylation in mammalian somatic cells. Our work demonstrates the utility of historic specimens for methylation analyses, as with genomic analyses; however, studies will need to accommodate the large variance in the quantity of data produced by older specimens.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Long-read Oxford nanopore sequencing offers advantages in identifying transcript isoforms and structural variants in human genomes. However, its widespread clinical use is limited by high costs and low throughput, with an entire \$800 ﬂow cell required for adequate genome coverage. Our recent experiments with the PromethION 2 (P2) yielded an average of 80 Gb sequence data per ﬂow cell but faced challenges like rapid pore deterioration after 48 hours and up to 30\% unassigned reads when using custom barcodes for multiplexing samples. Here we describe an approach that improves multiplexing and sequencing efﬁciency to support a sub-\$300 NGS assay with less than 5-day turnaround time for conﬁrmation of difﬁcult variants.
Methods: To address the high percentage of unassigned reads, we tested i) longer transposon-based (Tn5) barcodes (24mer and 36mer) and ii) native barcodes (24mer). We designed 3 unique Tn-5 based barcodes of each length and tested 10 native barcodes. We used gDNA from benchmark sample NA12878 and Lambda control to test barcode assignment efﬁciency. We multiplexed 3 samples per ﬂow cell (R10.4.1) and ran samples on the P2 Solo. To improve the total yield of each ﬂow cell, we i) extended run time to 4 days an ii) monitored pore health and performed a wash/reload cycle when the available pore count dropped below 30\% of the starting value. Real-time base calling and sample demultiplexing were performed in MinKNOW. Performance was measured by genome coverage, SNP detection, methylation proﬁling and variant detection using well characterized Genome-in-a-Bottle (GIAB) samples.
Results: When compared with the 16mer barcodes (30\% unclassiﬁed reads), the Tn5-attached indexes of 24mer and 36mer had fewer unclassiﬁed reads (15\% and 18\%, respectively), suggesting improved performance of longer barcodes. In comparison, native barcodes performed best, with a mean 9\% unclassiﬁed reads and better uniformity among classiﬁed barcodes. Tn5 sheared NA12878 library (average 14kb) loading on a single P2 ﬂow cell yielded a total output of 151 Gb after washing and re-loading at 54 hours with an extended run of 4 days, which gave a 39X overall depth across the human genome. We then multiplexed g-tube sheared DNA of NA12878, NA24385 and NA06905 using native barcodes and performed sequencing on a single ﬂow cell that generated a total output of 154 Gb in 96 hours. After barcode demultiplexing, each GIAB sample obtained a mean 12X depth and N50 of 6.5kb with SNP detection sensitivity greater than 98\% for both NA12878 and NA24385. In NA06905, a female FMR1 premutation carrier, we were able to detect the premutation allele with 75 CGG repeats and also observed DNA methylation in associated reads, matching what is reported in the literature. In addition, we evaluated variant detection in NA24385 with 100\% sensitivity (30/30) for deletions {\textgreater}10kb.
Conclusion: Nuclease wash and sample reloading increased the output of a PromethiON ﬂow cell by over 80\%, and sample multiplexing in this study reduced whole genome sequencing cost to below \$300 per sample. With the help of GPU base call, real-time demultiplexing and genome alignment, the sample-toresult turnaround time was shortened to 5 days. Our study shows that a clinically viable, cost-effective, and rapid long-read sequencing method is feasible. This method may have broad applications for variant orthogonal conﬁrmation or discovery.},

Using deep sequencing, we have profiled small non-coding RNAs in Hydra magnipapillata and investigated changes in small RNA expression pattern during head regeneration. Our results reveal a unique repertoire of small RNAs in hydra. We have identified 126 miRNA loci; 123 of these miRNAs are unique to hydra. Less than 50\% are conserved across two different strains of Hydra vulgaris tested in this study, indicating a highly diverse nature of hydra miRNAs in contrast to bilaterian miRNAs. We also identified siRNAs derived from precursors with perfect stem–loop structure and that arise from inverted repeats. piRNAs were the most abundant small RNAs in hydra, mapping to transposable elements, the annotated transcriptome and unique non-coding regions on the genome. piRNAs that map to transposable elements and the annotated transcriptome display a ping–pong signature. Further, we have identified several miRNAs and piRNAs whose expression is regulated during hydra head regeneration. Our study defines different classes of small RNAs in this cnidarian model system, which may play a role in orchestrating gene expression essential for hydra regeneration.},

A complex bursting nano-injector of venom, the cnidocyst, is embedded in cnidocytes and enables cnidarians to paralyze their prey and predators, contributing to this phylum’s evolutionary success. In this work, we show that post-transcriptional regulation by a pan-cnidarian microRNA, miR-2022, is essential for biogenesis of these cells in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. By manipulation of miR-2022 levels in a transgenic reporter line of cnidocytes, followed by transcriptomics, single-cell data analysis, prey paralysis assays, and cell sorting of transgenic cnidocytes, we reveal that miR-2022 enables cnidocyte biogenesis in Nematostella, while exhibiting a conserved expression domain with its targets in cnidocytes of other cnidarian species. Thus, here we revealed a functional basis to the conservation of one of nature’s most ancient microRNAs.},
