  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I need to finalize species selection. The criteria are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Octocoral species, since these have generally extracted better for Andrea than old stony corals</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Specimens available for a range of collection dates spanning ~100 years, including a modern collection (within the last ~20 years)</p></li>
<li><p>A well-annotated genome is available for the species (or a very close relative)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With these criteria in mind, Andrea suggested a few octocoral species that have high-quality genome annotations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Eunicea knighti</em>: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_965233905.1/" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_965233905.1/</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Leptogorgia sarmentosa</em>: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_964658295.1/" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_964658295.1/</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Gorgonia ventalina</em>: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_964194065.1/" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_964194065.1/</a></p></li>
</ul>
<section id="inventory-search" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inventory-search">Inventory search</h3>
<p>For <em>Eunicea</em> and <em>Leptogorgia</em>, the museum doesn’t have significant collection of the species with annotated genomes. However, they may have more abundant material from a close relative. To check this, I searched the <a href="https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/">collections inventory</a> for the two genera, including a filter for only collections that were preserved and stored “Dry”, and downloaded the results as CSVs. I also did the same for <em>G. ventalina</em> to get a sense of how many specimens we have of this species across a range of collection dates.</p>
<p>Looks like the three species in the <em>Eunicea</em> and <em>Leptogorgia</em> genera with decent number of specimens are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>E. flexuosa</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>E. tourneforti</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>L. alba</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of the <em>Eunicea</em> species have multiple specimens from the turn of the century (~1900) and from modern collections, so I’ll take a look at the corals themselves to try to get a sense of material quantity/quality. For the potentially promising <em>Leptogorgia</em> (<em>L. alba</em>), there’s only one specimen from before 1900, and none within the last 25 years, so we wouldn’t be able to cover multiple timepoints. <strong>I’m going to exclude <em>Leptogorgia spp</em>. from consideration.</strong></p>
<p>Also check availability of <em>G. ventalina.</em></p>

<p><strong>E. flexuosa</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All dried specimens have retained natural color (rust-brown), confirming they were not bleached in the preservation process – this is ideal for us!</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Abundant material from late-1800s (~1885-1900) collections. 15-20 individuals, most specimens are quite large, ~1ft in diameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Quite a bit of material from mid-1900s (1945-1959), with ~15 large individuals</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>ton</em> of material from collections between 1960 and 1972, ~30 large specimens, some very large. This might be an ideal “middle” timepoint.</p></li>
<li><p>The only “modern” collections I see are 6 specimens collected in in the last 25 years (2000, 2002, 2004, and 2019), and they’re all very small, just a couple inches in length and not fully branching. I’d have to be very careful and judicious when subsampling these.</p></li>

<p>In the museum database, there are two different attributions used for <em>E. tourneforti</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eunicea tourneforti atra Verrill, 1901</li>

<ul>
<li>Eunicea tourneforti tourneforti Milne Edwards &amp; Haime, 1857</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a difference? Has the species been revised?</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><em>E. tourneforti</em> may be a better Eunicea species to work with because it is more closely related to the species for which we have a high-quality genome, <em>E. knighti</em> (<span class="citation" data-cites="d17030173">Sarmiento et al. (2025)</span>)</p>

</div></li>
<li><p>The branches of <em>E. tournefortini</em> are much thicker than those of <em>E. flexuosa</em>, which may prove beneficial for successfully extracting DNA</p></li>
<li><p>Several specimens (5-10) from the turn of the century, all of a good size (6-12 inches in length, branching)</p></li>
<li><p>~30 specimens from 1960s and 1970s, all with plenty of material (~1ft in length, branching). As with <em>E. flexuosa</em>, this seems like an ideal “mid-age” timepoint.</p></li>
<li><p>6 from early 2000s collections (2002, 2009). All are quite small, just a few inches in length and not very branched. Two, however, are quite thick, so contain more material.</p></li>
<li><p>Another 6 from 2019 collection (thanks Prof McFadden!). As in others, these specimens are short (~3 inches) and unbranched, but much thicker than the <em>E. flexuosa</em> counterparts. One is actually a bit larger too, ~6 inches long and forked.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>G. ventalina</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Little material from turn-of the century. I saw 2 specimens from before 1900, and both were very small, maybe 2 inches in diameter – I would be really worried about destructively sampling these, expecially because the lacy growth form of <em>G. ventalina</em> means there’s less tissue by surface area, so I may need to take more. There were 3 specimens from early 1900s, and these were larger (6-12 inches in diameter). One, however, was almost white – a contrast to the dark purple color of the other specimens – which suggested to me it may have either been treated (i.e.&nbsp;bleached) or more degraded.</p></li>
<li><p>As in the other species, plenty of specimens (30-40) and material (~1ft in diameter) from the 1960s and 70s.</p></li>
<li><p>Very little modern material, I only saw 2-3 small specimens from the early 2000s.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="conclusions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>We don’t have a sufficient range of collection dates of any <em>Leptogorgia</em> species, and both the very old and very recent specimens of <em>G. ventalina</em> are potentially too small for subsampling. This leaves one of the <em>Eunicea</em> species, using the <em>E. knighti</em> genome as reference. Both <em>E. flexuosa</em> and <em>E. tourneforti</em> have sufficient material from an appropriate range of collection dates. However, <em>E. tourneforti</em> is more closely related to our reference <em>E. knighti</em>; has more specimens and material available for the critical modern reference; and is thicker, potentially providing more tissue for extraction. Because of these considerations, <strong>I think <em>E. tourneforti</em> is the best choice!</strong></p>

<p>Compiled below is a breakdown of what ONT consumables need to be purchased for library prep and sequencing, including number and estimated cost. I’ve also included a list of required 3rd party reagents. Any that are not available at LAB will also need to be purchased.</p>
<p>Since we’ve decided to use the MinION platform available at the Smithsonian, instead of finding a PromethION to use externally, I need to determine how many flow cells we’ll need to sequence N=15 samples (3 time points at n=5).</p>
<p>Coral genome: 500 Mb<br>
10X read depth: 5,000 Mb = 5 Gb<br>
MinION output* : 30 Gb<br>
<strong>Multiplexing max = 6 samples/flow cell</strong></p>
<p>To err on the conservative side, let’s say 4 samples per flow cell. Then we’d <strong>need 4 flow cells to multiplex all samples</strong>. It would also be prudent to have an extra flow cell in case of issues (e.g.&nbsp;improper loading). We should also get some flongles<sup>+</sup> (basically cheap, low-output flow cells) for trial runs (e.g.&nbsp;to check successful library prep, to check endogenous DNA levels as a QC).</p>
<p>*The theoretical maximum output of a MinION flow cell is 48Gb, but this seems unlikely given the reported experiences of colleagues. Will instead use the more conservative estimate of 30Gb.<br>
<sup>+</sup>Note that an adapter is required to use Flongle Flow Cells. If the Smithsonian doesn’t already have one it would need to be purchased. The same link included below also provides the option to purchase an adapter and 12 flongle flow cells for ~$1600.</p>

<p>Dan recommends purchasing additional Flow Cell Wash Kits, since you may use multiple reactions in a single sequencing run (i.e.&nbsp;you may want to wash the flow cell several times within a run).</p>
<p>Additionally, the LAB doesn’t currently have a Flongle Adapter, so we’ll need to purchase one. We can purchase a bundle that includes the Adapter, reagents, and 12 Flongle Flow Cells for a reduced price.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background"><strong>Background:</strong></h4>
<p>Trying Nanopore sequencing for methylation mapping of ancient bear samples (5500 and 2500 years old, from Alaska, bone and teeth). Using a PromethION.</p>
</section>
<section id="notes" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notes">Notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Used <strong>Ligation kit</strong> instead of Rapid, because Rapid is optimized for longer reads, have not tried Rapid. Note that they did <em>not</em> multiplex, so they were using the Ligation kit <em>without</em> barcoding. They also had way less DNA than recommended for the kit (&lt;100ng compared to the recommended 1000ng).</p></li>
<li><p>For them, adaptive sequencing was not helpful in identifying the short reads. However, they haven’t tried using it as an depletion step to exclude known contaminant sequences. Not entirely sure how software would respond to the short reads – would it try to reject them?</p></li>
<li><p>Suggest standard <strong>genomic sequencing as a QC step</strong> to identify which samples have the most endogenous content. Could this be done in-house at the Smithsonian?</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast to Dan’s experience (presumably with amplified DNA), they’ve noted their <strong>unamplified libraries are <em>not</em> stable.</strong> With the ligation kit, they’ve (anecdotally) had ~1hr to get a prepped library to sequencing. They would <strong>strongly recommend we stick with the available MinION</strong>, instead of looking for an outside PromethION, because of the risks of library degradation.</p></li>
<li><p>They’ve noted that the <strong>flow cells can be finniky</strong> – differences in number of functioning pores, pores degrade quickly, etc. Wash step helps output but still issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Been observing 5-8X coverage to call methlation with some confidence. They’ve also been working with modern comparisons, and the biggest difference in ancient vs modern samples for methylation calling was coverage. <strong>Haven’t noted any major differences introduced by fragmented input</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Biggest issue is that their coverage is spotty – they get no data for some regions and lots of data for others – and that their genome isn’t fully annotated, so they have little context for some of their coverage.</p></li>
<li><p>Size select: They haven’t been implementing for nanopore, but have for normal Illumina. Using Pippin, better with short reads than bead. Does Rapid Kit already incorporate a size selection?</p></li>
<li><p>Sawyer 2024 compared EMseq and WGBS for ancient samples, and concluded that WGBS is better for ancient.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, <strong>the Nanopore sequencing works – they got data – but it just hasn’t been cost effective for them</strong>. They’re going to be trying WGBS soon. Noted that they also don’t know much about other attempts to use Nanopore for aDNA/hDNA methylation mapping, or about how it compares to WGBS/EMSeq. They’ve heard anecdotally about other labs considering, but there are just no published results (or negative results).</p></li>
<li><p>Note: they were working with very little DNA (maybe 100ng), highly fragmented, and for a species with a large genome (~3Gb, close to a human).</p></li>
<li><p>We may have more success/it may be more cost effective since we have newer/potentially better-preserved specimens, and the genomes are so much shorter. While they were unable to incorporate multiplexing, we likely can with success. Suggested <strong>running a single sample on its own flow cell</strong> first to get a sense of how much output/coverage we’ll get. Flongle for this?</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="takeaways" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways">Takeaways:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Should use Ligation Kit instead of Rapid. Rapid is optimized for longer reads. It also includes “transposase chemistry” which seems to perform some type of DNA shearing, which we don’t want with our fragmented reads.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Native Barcoding Kit 24 is same price as Rapid Barcoding Kit 24</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://nanoporetech.com/support/library-prep/rapid-kits/can-i-use-small-dna-fragments-with-the-rapid-kits?filter=fragmented">ONT reccommends</a> Rapid Kit not be used with fragments &lt;500nt</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Stick with the MinION</p></li>
<li><p>Having a well-annotated genome is important, so keep that in mind when selecting samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize the QC steps to select samples with as much long-read, endogenous DNA as possible</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notes">Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Smithsonian has a MinION!</p></li>
<li><p>flow cells have pretty short shelf life, so even if other Smithsonian folks have leftover reagents, will likely need to order new</p></li>
<li><p>will need a reference genome, both for downstream analyses and for adaptive sampling</p>
<ul>
<li><p>could also use a de novo genome from sequencing the recent samples</p></li>
<li><p>with very fresh tissue, since the genome is p small, could get close to chromosome level genome assembly with nanopore. Andrea notes though that they’ve had a lot of trouble with assembling coral genomes, possibly due to weird genome architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>So maybe genome assembly could be a bonus if the species we use ends up being straightforward to assemble, but for now we should try to find samples that at least fall in same genus as a published genome. Will be trickier if we’re using octocorals (for the better sequencing)</p></li>
<li><p>Andrea will look at the collections and available octocoral genomes to see if there’s a good candidate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>adaptive sampling could help reduce sequencing of contaminants, but might be less useful with degraded dna (short reads can end up being fully sequenced before pores have a chance to kick them out)</p></li>
<li><p>Will ideally want 20x - 30x coverage for methylation calls. Can probably look into what coverage v depth we want for methylation calling</p></li>
<li><p>MinION flowcell specs: <a href="https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/flow-cell-r10-4-1-2025.html" class="uri">https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/flow-cell-r10-4-1-2025.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>could try a test run with minion flongle: <a href="https://nanoporetech.com/products/sequence/flongle" class="uri">https://nanoporetech.com/products/sequence/flongle</a></p></li>
<li><p>look/ask around about accessing a promethion.</p></li>
<li><p>With the wash kits you don’t actually run the while library each time, you split it up. SO using wash doesn’t require more library.</p></li>
<li><p>Will need to check seq length/molarity (Smithsonian has the tools for this)</p></li>
<li><p>Expect fragmentation to be an issue. In Andrea’s experience, coral hDNA fragments are max ~1000bp. Should look into how fragmentation could/will affect methylation calling. Could think about a size selection? Should ask folks in meeting next week about their experience</p></li>
<li><p>make a list of things Andrea needs to buy.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="my-to-dos" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-to-dos">My to-dos:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Look more into what coverage v depth we want for methylation calling</p></li>
<li><p>Look into how use of fragmented DNA can affect methylation calling, including any differences between MinION and PromethION</p></li>
<li><p>Looks into accessing a PromethION sequencer at a nearby facility</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Johns Hopkins (Baltimore, MD) has a PromethION, but I can’t find additional details for requesting use right now, because the webpage for their <a href="http://grcf.med.jhu.edu/">Genetic Resources Core Facility</a> is down</p></li>
<li><p>NIH Center for Cancer Research (Bethesda, MD) is close , but it looks like they only allow NIH employees/affiliates to use their <a href="https://ostr.ccr.cancer.gov/resources/provider_details/nih-intramural-sequencing-center-nisc">sequencing facilities</a>. I’d also guess they’re in a lot of tummult right now</p></li>
<li><p>UW has a Nanopore Sequencing Core which uses a PromethION. Note sure if I can request a quote from them without sample details (e.g.&nbsp;extraction method, dna concentration), but they have a table of cost estimates <a href="https://millerlaboratory.com/uw-nsc.html">here</a>.<br>
If I’m understanding the “services” correctly, it looks like it’s $1,210/flow cell and ~$40/sample for Barcoding with Rapid Prep libraries. I may also be cheaper if we want to multiplex 4 or more samples on a single flow cell.</p>
<p>So say we wanted to do 12 samples, multiplex w 4 samples per flow cell: 1210*(3 flow cells) + 40*(12 samples) = $4,110</p>
<p>Optimistically I think we could do it on just two PromethION flow cells: 1210*2+40*12 = $2,900</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Notes from 4/10 meeting with Andrea to discuss SIFP fellowship this summer</p>
<p>Action Items:</p>
<p><strong>Tenure dates.</strong> Proposal stated 07/01/2025 - 09/12/2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>This works for Andrea!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Budgeting and sourcing research funds.</strong> What is estimated cost of project (see <a href="../../../posts/projects/SIFP_2025/2025_04_09_SIFP_planning.html">here</a> for breakdown of sequencing costs) and how will Andrea and/or Steven be supporting with funding?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Materials and reagents for extraction and QC are largely/fully available through the LAB communal resources, so library prep and sequencing are the only costs.</p></li>
<li><p>200ng (minimum for Nanopore Rapid Barcoding Kit) is a totally feasible DNA quantity. Need to consider though that the DNA will be “dirty,” containing mold, symbiont, etc. Need to consider how to clean up and how much total DNA we need to get 200ng of <em>coral</em> DNA.</p></li>
<li><p>LAB doesn’t seem to have a nanopore sequencing platform, so we may need to send samples out for sequencing. Need to look into how cost will change. Can still be kept low with multiplexing though.</p></li>
<li><p>MinION vs.&nbsp;PromethION?</p></li>
<li><p>Andrea is working with a NOAA scientist, Dan, who is experienced with nanopore sequencing and interested in using it more. Andrea will set up a meeting w him to discuss sequencing options.</p></li>
<li><p>Andrea can fully support with research funding, and will thus be senior author on resultant papers (notify Steven)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How/when to begin sourcing specimens?</strong> Does Andrea have an inventory database of some kind so I can begin looking for suitable species and collections dates?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Focus on dried specimens, since they yield better DNA quality/quantity than wet-stored. Andrea’s been seeing higher DNA yield from octocorals than stony, but octocorals potentially less interesting for enviornmental resilience questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Since multiplexing will likely keep sequencing costs lows, maybe we could do 15 stony and 15 octo?</p></li>
<li><p>GBR and maybe Carribean for sourcing old specimens. Maybe we can just use the same specimens as in <span class="citation" data-cites="connelly_unlocking_2024">Connelly, Catapang, and Quattrini (2024)</span> , since we know many yielded sufficient DNA for sequencing. None are type specimens, so additional sampling would likely be fine.</p></li>
<li><p>museum inventory: <a href="https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/">https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project timeline.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>likely need 1 week for setup, maybe 2 weeks for first round of extractions/QC. Unsure what the sequencing timeline will be if we have to send it out, but the a PromethION sequencing run takes ~3 days.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally I’d get a full round of samples sequenced in first 5 weeks, then be able to do a second round (e.g.&nbsp;work out the kinks with the higher-yield octocoral samples, then try for stony samples)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extra from 4/10 Lab Meeting, talking w Shelly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contact ONT! They may be able to provide guidance on workflow modifications for using low quantity/quality DNA</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://bcmb.bs.jhmi.edu/people/winston-timp/">Winston Timp</a>, works in developing sequencing tech and has done lots with Nanopore tech. Can try looking through his related publications or contacting (can use Shelly as contact)</p></li>

<p>I’m meeting with Andrea tomorrow to discuss the SIFP project, so I spent some time researching the Nanopore direct sequencing workflow and associated costs.</p>
<section id="multiplexing" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Multiplexing:</strong></h1>
<p>PromethION and MionION platforms support multiplexing, where DNA is tagged with sample-specific barcodes during library prep, allowing multiple samples to be run simultaneously on a single flow cell. Since flow cells are the most expensive component of nanopore sequencing by far, multiplexing could dramatically reduce the sequencing cost per sample.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation" data-cites="rubi_museum_2020">Rubi, Knowles, and Dantzer (2020)</span>, while recommended minimum read depth for methylation analysis is 10X, their hDNA samples showed little difference in # of CpG positions for a minimum read depth of 5X and 10X. So our goal should be a minimum of 10X depth, but lower could be acceptable?</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="deng_p646_2024">Deng et al. (2024)</span> used a PromethION for WGS of the human genome and multiplexed 3 samples per cell, incorporating a cell wash to improve performance, and generated 154 Gb of output with a final mean read depth of 12X. This tracks with ONT’s specifications of 100-200 Gb output gDNA reads from a PromethION flow cell. NOTE though that the human genome is *much* larger than a coral genome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we assume an output of 150 Gb (150,000 Mb), how many samples could be multiplexed while maintaining minimum read depth?<br>
</p>
<p>Human genome: 3,000 Mb<br>
10X read depth: 30,000 Mb<br>
Sequencing output: 150,000 Mb<br>
Multiplexing max = 5 samples/flow cell</p>
<p>Coral genome: 500 Mb<br>
10X read depth: 5,000 Mb<br>
Sequencing output: 150,000 Mb<br>
<strong>Multiplexing max = 30 samples/flow cell</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Say we want 3 time points (e.g., 100yo, 50yo, &lt;20yo). Probably need a minimum of n=5 for each, so minimum of N=15.</p>
<p>I think we’d easily be able to run all 15 samples on a single flow cell! Since flow cells are only sold in packs of 4, we’ll also end up with extra to do more sequencing if desired/possible.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="choosing-library-prep" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Choosing library prep</strong></h1>
<p><img src="https://shedurkin.github.io/Roberts-LabNotebook/posts/projects/SIFP_2025/images/nanopore_library_prep.PNG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Rapid (ligation-free) library prep kit seems best. Of the methylation-friendly options, it requires the least input DNA (still kind of high though? 100ng?). It also has barcode options to support multiplexing!</p>
</section>
<section id="cost-estimate" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Cost estimate:</strong></h1>
<p>Assuming minimum N=15 on a PromethION, incorporating multiplexing to reduce cost/sample.</p>
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Item</td>
<td># rxns/unit</td>
<td>Price ($/unit)</td>
<td># units</td>
<td>Total cost</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><a href="https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/rapid-barcoding-sequencing-kit-96-v14.html">Rapid Barcoding Kit 96 V14</a></td>
<td>96</td>
<td>1100</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1100</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><a href="https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/promethion-flow-cell-packs-r10-4-1-m-version-2025.html">PromethION Flow Cell Packs (R10.4.1)</a></td>
<td>1 pack: 4 cells</td>
<td>3980</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>3980</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><a href="https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/productDetail/?id=flow-cell-wash">Flow Cell Wash Kit</a></td>
<td>6</td>
<td>115</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>115</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>5,195</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So estimated cost of library prep and sequencing for N=15 samples on a PromethION sequencing platform is <strong>$5,195</strong>. Note that this could be reduced by a few hundred dollars by buying a 24-reaction library prep kit, but it’s dramatically more cost effective to buy the 96-reaction kit. That also gives us plenty of wiggle room for unsuccessful library prep or sequencing.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn’t take DNA extraction and QC into account. I’ll need to talk to Andrea about this portion since the LAB has some community-available resources and the number of samples I’ll extract/QC will be strongly influenced by extraction success.</p>
