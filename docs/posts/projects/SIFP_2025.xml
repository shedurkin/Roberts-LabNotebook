<p>I’m meeting with Andrea tomorrow to discuss the SIFP project, so I spent some time researching the Nanopore direct sequencing workflow and associated costs.</p>
<section id="multiplexing" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Multiplexing:</strong></h1>
<p>PromethION and MionION platforms support multiplexing, where DNA is tagged with sample-specific barcodes during library prep, allowing multiple samples to be run simultaneously on a single flow cell. Since flow cells are the most expensive component of nanopore sequencing by far, multiplexing could dramatically reduce the sequencing cost per sample.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation" data-cites="rubi_museum_2020">Rubi, Knowles, and Dantzer (2020)</span>, while recommended minimum read depth for methylation analysis is 10X, their hDNA samples showed little difference in # of CpG positions for a minimum read depth of 5X and 10X. So our goal should be a minimum of 10X depth, but lower could be acceptable?</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="deng2024">(<strong>deng2024?</strong>)</span> used a PromethION for WGS of the human genome and multiplexed 3 samples per cell, incorporating a cell wash to improve performance, and generated 154 Gb of output with a final mean read depth of 12X. This tracks with ONT's specifications of 100-200 Gb output gDNA reads from a PromethION flow cell. NOTE though that the human genome is *much* larger than a coral genome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we assume an output of 150 Gb (150,000 Mb), how many samples could be multiplexed while maintaining minimum read depth?<br>
</p>
<p>Human genome: 3,000 Mb<br>
10X read depth: 30,000 Mb<br>
Sequencing output: 150,000 Mb<br>
Multiplexing max = 5 samples/flow cell</p>
<p>Coral genome: 500 Mb<br>
10X read depth: 5,000 Mb<br>
Sequencing output: 150,000 Mb<br>
<strong>Multiplexing max = 30 samples/flow cell</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Say we want 3 time points (e.g., 100yo, 50yo, &lt;20yo). Probably need a minimum of n=5 for each, so minimum of N=15.</p>
<p>I think we'd easily be able to run all 15 samples on a single flow cell! Since flow cells are only sold in packs of 4, we'll also end up with extra to do more sequencing if desired/possible.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="choosing-library-prep" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Choosing library prep</strong></h1>
<p><img src="https://shedurkin.github.io/Roberts-LabNotebook/posts/projects/SIFP_2025/images/nanopore_library_prep.PNG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Rapid (ligation-free) library prep kit seems best. Of the methylation-friendly options, it requires the least input DNA (still kind of high though? 100ng?). It also has barcode options to support multiplexing!</p>
</section>
<section id="cost-estimate" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Cost estimate:</strong></h1>
<p>Assuming minimum N=15 on a PromethION, incorporating multiplexing to reduce cost/sample.</p>
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Item</td>
<td># rxns/unit</td>
<td>Price ($/unit)</td>
<td># units</td>
<td>Total cost</td>

<tr class="even">

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

<td>115</td>

<td>115</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>5,195</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So estimated cost of library prep and sequencing for N=15 samples on a PromethION sequencing platform is <strong>$5,195</strong>. Note that this could be reduced by a few hundred dollars by buying a 24-reaction library prep kit, but it's dramatically more cost effective to buy the 96-reaction kit. That also gives us plenty of wiggle room for unsuccessful library prep or sequencing.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn't take DNA extraction and QC into account. I'll need to talk to Andrea about this portion since the LAB has some community-available resources and the number of samples I'll extract/QC will be strongly influenced by extraction success.</p>
