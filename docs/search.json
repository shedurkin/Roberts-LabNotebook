    "text": "Notes from 4/10 meeting with Andrea to discuss SIFP fellowship this summer\nAction Items:\nTenure dates. Proposal stated 07/01/2025 - 09/12/2025.\n\nThis works for Andrea!\n\nBudgeting and sourcing research funds. What is estimated cost of project (see here for breakdown of sequencing costs) and how will Andrea and/or Steven be supporting with funding?\n\nMaterials and reagents for extraction and QC are largely/fully available through the LAB communal resources, so library prep and sequencing are the only costs.\n200ng (minimum for Nanopore Rapid Barcoding Kit) is a totally feasible DNA quantity. Need to consider though that the DNA will be “dirty,” containing mold, symbiont, etc. Need to consider how to clean up and how much total DNA we need to get 200ng of coral DNA.\nLAB doesn’t seem to have a nanopore sequencing platform, so we may need to send samples out for sequencing. Need to look into how cost will change. Can still be kept low with multiplexing though.\nMinION vs. PromethION?\nAndrea is working with a NOAA scientist, Dan, who is experienced with nanopore sequencing and interested in using it more. Andrea will set up a meeting w him to discuss sequencing options.\nAndrea can fully support with research funding, and will thus be senior author on resultant papers (notify Steven)\n\nHow/when to begin sourcing specimens? Does Andrea have an inventory database of some kind so I can begin looking for suitable species and collections dates?\n\nFocus on dried specimens, since they yield better DNA quality/quantity than wet-stored. Andrea’s been seeing higher DNA yield from octocorals than stony, but octocorals potentially less interesting for enviornmental resilience questions.\nSince multiplexing will likely keep sequencing costs lows, maybe we could do 15 stony and 15 octo?\nGBR and maybe Carribean for sourcing old specimens. Maybe we can just use the same specimens as in Connelly, Catapang, and Quattrini (2024) , since we know many yielded sufficient DNA for sequencing. None are type specimens, so additional sampling would likely be fine.\nmuseum inventory: https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/\n\nProject timeline.\n\nlikely need 1 week for setup, maybe 2 weeks for first round of extractions/QC. Unsure what the sequencing timeline will be if we have to send it out, but the a PromethION sequencing run takes ~3 days.\nIdeally I’d get a full round of samples sequenced in first 5 weeks, then be able to do a second round (e.g. work out the kinks with the higher-yield octocoral samples, then try for stony samples)\n\nExtra from 4/10 Lab Meeting, talking w Shelly:\n\nContact ONT! They may be able to provide guidance on workflow modifications for using low quantity/quality DNA\nWinston Timp, works in developing sequencing tech and has done lots with Nanopore tech. Can try looking through his related publications or contacting (can use Shelly as contact)\nAdaptive sampling\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nConnelly, Michael T., Mary Grace Catapang, and Andrea M.

See all details and original data collection in physical lab notebook, digital copy of mortality and meta data here.\nAs a reminder, I have diploid and triploid Pacific oysters that were hardened using 6 treatments of 35C for 4hours, over the course of 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of recovery they were brought back to FTR, acclimated, sampled, and used in a survivorship test of 42C Resazurin for 4hours. However, since I made the mistake of pooling all oysters in each treatment group, I compromised independence, making the results statistically meaningless. During this second attempt at a survivorship trial I’ll keep all individual oysters in separate containers, and I won’t be using Resazurin, since the ambient temp Resazurin groups in the first survivorship test still saw high mortality. For the purposes of this second survivorship test, survivorship round 1 will essentially be treated like an additional hardening treatment."

Then placed each oyster in an appropriately sized container. Want to maintain a roughly 1:5 oyster to water volume ratio (1:4 was insufficient to cover some of the heavily cupped oysters), so each container needed to hold at least 6x the oyster volume. Used mix of plastic cups with lids and glass graduated cylinders of several sizes to hold all oysters.\nFilled each cup with seawater of the appropriate temperature (20C or 42C), maintaining a 1:5 oyster:water volume ratio. I also set a minimum water volume of 15mL to ensure the smaller oysters were still fully covered. Filled cups in random order, placing 42C cups in the 42C incubator once filled. 20C cups were left on countertop. Filling took ~30min.\nOnce all cups were filled, began the survivorship test. Checked all cups for mortality every hour. Ended test at 5hours, after roughly 30% of stressed oysters had died.\nRemoved all oysters from 42C incubator. Replaced the water in all cups with 20C seawater, filling to a 1:6 volume ratio to reduce risk of hypoxia during recovery.\nChecked for mortality in all oysters daily, and replaced all oysters’ water with fresh 20C seawater daily. Note that no food is added to seawater, so last time these oysters were fed was Aug. 6, during their recovery from survivorship round 1."

    "text": "Update 8/22\nAs of 8/22 we’re sitting at roughly 50% mortality in the round 2 stressed oysters and roughly 10% mortality in the controls. Interestingly, while there doesn’t appear to be any difference among the original hardening groups, the round 1 survivorship does seem to have had a hardening effect!\nSeveral possible explanations for this observation:\n\nThe original hardening did have an effect, but it was too subtle to see with our reduced sample sizes\nThe original hardening was too long ago – it’s effects were short-term and are no longer manifest, 4 weeks later\nThe original hardening was performed at too low a temperature to see an effect at 42C stress. The original hardening was done at 35C, while survivorship round 1 was at 42C, the same temperature the oysters then experienced during this survivorship round. My brief review of other papers that attempted hardening in bivalves did suggest that hardening was most effective when conditions were similar to those the organism would experience during an extreme stress event post-hardening.\n\n\n\nCode\n#####################\n### Load Packages ###\n#####################\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n#################\n### Load Data ###\n#################\n\nround2 &lt;- read.csv(\"../../../../../Data/Pacific_oysters/2024_08_22_Survivorship_Round2.csv\")\n\n####################\n### Data Munging ###\n####################\n\n# Convert mort_date to Date format\nround2 &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(mort_date = as.Date(mort_date, format=\"%m/%d/%Y\"))\n\n# Calculate the total number of original samples in each group\ngroup_totals &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_samples = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Generate a sequence of dates covering the entire period\ndate_seq &lt;- seq(min(round2$mort_date, na.rm = TRUE), max(round2$mort_date, na.rm = TRUE), by = \"day\")\n# Add the date before start of experiment, to show original 0% mortality\ndate_seq &lt;- c(as.Date(\"2024-08-08\"), date_seq)\n\n# Create a data frame with all combinations of treatment group and date\nround2_full &lt;- expand.grid(group = unique(round2$group), \n                           date = date_seq)\n\n# Aggregate the data by group and date to get daily death counts\nround2_daily &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(group, mort_date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(deaths = n(), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  rename(date = mort_date)\n\n# Join the aggregated daily deaths with the full date range\nround2_cumulative &lt;- round2_full %&gt;%\n  left_join(round2_daily, by = c(\"group\", \"date\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(deaths = ifelse(is.na(deaths), 0, deaths)) %&gt;%  # Replace NA with 0 for days with no deaths\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(cumulative_deaths = cumsum(deaths)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Join with group totals to calculate cumulative deaths as a percentage\nround2_cumulative &lt;- round2_cumulative %&gt;%\n  left_join(group_totals, by = \"group\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(cumulative_death_percentage = (cumulative_deaths / total_samples) * 100)\n\n# retrieve metadata associated with groups\nmetadata &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  select(group, cattle_tag, round1_treatment, round2_treatment) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\nround2_cumulative_metadata &lt;- round2_cumulative %&gt;%\n  left_join(metadata, by = \"group\")\n\n################\n### Plot Data ##\n################\n\nlabels_df &lt;- round2_cumulative_metadata %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  filter(date == max(date)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(round2_cumulative_metadata, aes(x = date, y = cumulative_death_percentage, group = group, color = round1_treatment)) +\n  #geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ round2_treatment) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = labels_df, aes(label = group), size = 2.5, nudge_x = 0.3, check_overlap = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative mortality from Survivorship Round 2\",\n       x = \"Time\",\n       y = \"Cumulative mortality (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceted by Round 2 treatment, color indicates Round 1 treatment (i.e. “second hardening”)"

    "text": "Some notes and pictures from working with the FTR-stored oysters today.\n\nWhite spotting in extreme stress bags\nI noticed some tiny white dots covering portions of some oysters in the extreme stress trial bags (Trial 1 stressed bag, and Trial 2 stressed bag). See pictures below. After talking with Ariana we decided they’re probably just an odd type of tunicate. I rubbed off as much as I could, but I noted there do seem to be tiny holes left below where the dots were. Put the oysters back in the left FTR seawater tank.\n\n\n\n\nDissecting a dip/trip\nMy hardening experiment oysters are a wide range of sizes, so it’s likely I’ll be able to take more detailed tissue samples (e.g., specific tissue types, multiple samples from the same tissue). I want to open a larger oyster to see the anatomy clearly and get a sense of where everything is. I also want to check the reproductive maturity of some oysters from the hatchery.\nTo do this, pulled a large untreated diploid (bag “13”) and large untreated triploid (bag “Bird - Extra”) for dissection.\n\nDiploid\n\nNo developed gonad in the diploid\n\n\n\nThe diploid had some serious shell deterioration, particularly around the hinge. Looks to be the work of some kind of boring parasite that left the shell riddled with orange-something filled holes. The shell broke very easily and separated into layers. Notably, there was no obvious sign of this deterioration on the exterior of the shell.\nTook a look at some of the orange substance under the scope:\n\n\n\n\nTriploid\n\nThe triploid had a developed gonad!\n\n\nTook a gamete sample and examined under the scope:\n\nIt’s female! The eggs seem viable but underdeveloped – many have a vaguely tear-drop shape, rather than a filled-out circle.\nThis is just one diploid and triploid, but it’s interesting that the triploid is the only one with gametes. This could either mean that (a) the “Bird” oysters are not actually triploids, or (b) this is a case of a triploid not actually being sterile. Even though triploids are touted as being sterile, I’ve actually read a few papers noting triploids developing gametes in the field and, relevantly, triploid mortality being associated with fecund triploids!

    "text": "Second trial of an extreme stress test on our extra Pacific oysters. The experimental setup of Trial 1 didn’t work well, and ended up stress the oysters at the sublethal35-38C, instead of a lethal temp of 43C.\nThis time I’ll be using full bucket of water with a heater + thermostat, instead of warming water in the incubator. This should heat the water faster and better regulate the temperature following addition of oysters.\n\nTrial 2 protocol\n\nFilled two clean white plastic buckets with roughly 20L of seawater from the cold seawater tank in FTR. Placed digital thermostats and thermometers in both. To one bucket (the “treatment” bucket), added a rod heater decoupled from the thermostat. Heated the treatment bucket to 43C by manually monitoring the temperature and turning off heater once at temperature.\nNotes: I noticed while heating the treatment bucket that water at the top of the bucket warmed faster than water at the bottom. I added an additional thermostat so that one thermostat sensor was attached to the bottom of the bucket and one was attached the top of the bucket (see pictures). To ensure even heating, I manually mixed the water during heating until the two thermostats were within 1C of each other, repeating whenever the thermostats diverged by more than 1C. Whenever I mixed the treatment bucket, I would also mix the control bucket.\n\n\nIsolated two groups of 10 oysters from bag “13” (untreated diploid), selecting similarly sized sets of oysters, and placed in small mesh bags. Randomly assigned one bag to treatment and one to control. Labelled each with a labelled 15mL tube placed inside bag and colored zip ties attached to the bag (didn’t have any waterproof bag tags). Yellow and black is 43C group, blue and black is control. Measured length of each oyster in each group using a manual caliper, then placed back in respective labelled bags and placed bags in cold seawater tank for roughly 1hr\nNotes: Noticed a few dead oysters in the source bag “13”, all on the small side.\n\n\n\nOnce the treatment seawater bucket was at 43C, I began the stress trial. I placed the “treatment” bag of oysters in the 43C bucket, and the “control” bag of oysters in the bucket of ambient water (roughly 17C). The oysters remained in their respective buckets for 1 hr (16:30 - 17:30, 7/15/2024).\nI maintained the treatment water temperature of 43C by manually monitoring the thermostats and thermometer. When any of these temperature gauges dropped below 42C (a 1C variation) I turned the heater back on until all three temperature gauges were again at 43C. I also mixed the water the entire time the heater was on, to ensure even heating, and ensured the bag of oysters was not touching the heating element itself. I had to turn the heater on roughly every 15 minutes to maintain temperature.\nNotes: The thermostat whose sensor was at the top of the treatment bucket consistently displayed a temperature 1C below the thermostat placed at the bottom of the bucket. I’m not sure if this is because the top layer of water lost heat faster or because of a calibration difference in the thermostats. This means, however, that a drop below 42C in the top thermostat generally meant a drop to 42C in the bottom of the bucket, which means water at the bottom of the bucket likely never dropped below 42C.\nAfter the 1hr treatment, placed both bags of oysters back in the cold seawater tank in FTR.\nUnplugged all heaters and thermostats, emptied both buckets of seawater into the drains in the seawater room, and rinsed both with DI water.\nMonitor oysters in both groups for mortality once per day at roughly noon for the next 2 weeks.

This time I wanted to try oysters at a range of sizes. Selected 3 oysters of a range of sizes from both the “13” diploid cohort and the “Bird” triploid cohort (untreated). Placed each oyster in 700mL of algae-rich seawater (sourced from black tub and diluted until algae content was just below the quantifiable level of 199 ug/L using the FluoroSense fluorometer). Monitored for ~1hr at roughly 10min intervals. Took triplicate fluorometer readings each time.\nSee data entered here, or original data in the below notebook photos.\n\n\n\nNote: values shown are the third of each set of triplicate measurements from each time point (column “Fluoro3” in the raw datasheet)\n\n\nAs expected, the small oysters (13 26mm and Bird 24mm) have a much lower clearance rate. Interestingly though, all of the larger oysters (13 75mm, 13 88mm, Bird 61mm, and Bird 76mm) see to have pretty similar clearance rates, with the Bird 61mm oyster actually beating the others at most time points!\n\n\n\nTrial 3 oysters. “Bird” triploid untreated (top) and “13” diploid untreated (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial 3 setup\n\n\nOverall, since the fluorometer is non-invasive and very easy to use, it seems like the best option may just be to measure clearance rate of the full cohorts (i.e. place the full treatment bags in algae-rich water and monitor feeding). The oysters don’t always open to feed and the fluorometer doesn’t seem sensitive/consistent enough to use with smaller sample sizes.\nUnfortunately the FluoroSense fluorometer stopped working at roughly 15:15. It’s only displaying 0 readings, even for my control solution which was consistently reading at ~180 and was visibly clouded with algae. Matt and I tried recalibrating the fluorometer using the 800ppb Rhodamine calibration solution, but saw no change. There’s no visible damage, the display is functioning normally, and the blue fluorescence light is still working as usual, so I’m really not sure what the issue is :(\n\n\n\nNotebook photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUcar/ferry reciepts"

I then measured the length of each with calipers and separated into four treatment bags of 100 oysters each (2 bags of triploids, 2 bags of diploids). Oysters were not individually labelled/tagged. See photos of the datasheets below and digital spreadsheets here.\nObservations:\nThe diploids were generally a bit bigger, there were more oysters larger than the desired size range (20mm - 60mm), and there were more dead oysters. There were also several instances in both groups of two oysters fused together, and these were excluded from the oysters compiled for the experiment.6\nLength summary stats (mm):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBag\nSample size\nMin\nMax\nRange\nMean\nMedian\n\n\ntriploid control\n100\n23\n65\n42\n35.62\n34\n\n\ntriploid treatment\n100\n23\n54\n31\n32.47\n30\n\n\ndiploid control\n100\n18\n60\n42\n37.42\n36\n\n\ndiploid treatment\n100\n21\n65\n44\n39.77\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBags are green mesh, and were labelled with a number (Bag 1, Bag 2, Bag 3, Bag 4), ploidy (triploid or diploid), and treatment group (control or treatment), as well as the identifier “UW-KD, Roberts” to distinguish our bags from others in the hatchery.

After a hardening session they will be placed back in the ambient tanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature: 35C\nTime: 4 hours per session\nFrequency: 3 times/week for two weeks.

In other words, it would cost the same. Since The ferry route saves some time and involves less driving, I’m going to stick with it."

Accelerated metabolism/ATP turnover to provide additional energy in support of cellular maintenance/damage repair, and accompanying increase in feeding or changes in energy allocation. Also often fueled by utilizing energy stores (e.g. glycogen and lipid stores).\nextreme stress (pessimism): Conservation. Slow-down of metabolism and physiological activity to conserve energy resources and reduce accumulation of intracellular waste from compensatory activity. All available energy devoted to somatic maintenance, rather than growth, reproduction, or storage. In extreme cases, may enter metabolically arrested state, temporarily suppressing activity below maintenance levels to conserve energy until normal function becomes possible. This metabolic arrest is particularly common in animals native to extreme environments (e.g. the intertidal)"

    "title": "Lit Review: DNA methylation mapping with hDNA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Literature review on DNA methylation mapping of historical DNA (hDNA), collected from museum specimens. Prepping for SIFP proposal to work with Andrea Quattrini at the Smithsonian NMNH.\n\nWhat is hDNA?\nRaxworthy and Smith (2021) define historical DNA (hDNA) as “the DNA fortuitously contained in the tissues of traditional voucher specimens that are stored in museums and herbaria,” usually &lt;200 years old. Importantly, this is distinguished from ancient DNA (aDNA), which is “DNA recovered from organic material (e.g., bone, plant matter, environmental samples, and subfossils) that is preserved under natural conditions” and is often much older, more degraded, and lower quantity than hDNA. It is also distinguished from tissues collected expressly as DNA samples (and their extracts), which Raxworthy and Smith term “modern DNA.”\nFor the purposes of this proposal, hDNA would potentially be collected from dried and liquid-stored coral specimens, preferably those collected ≥100 year ago. This age preference has two reasonings. First, beginning in the early 1900s many museum specimens were “fixed” (preserved as fluid voucher specimens) in formalin, a formaldehyde solution, which we now know presents many complications for DNA work. Second, for this project the value of museum archives lies in their collections of specimens that predate the serious impacts of anthropogenic climate change and environmental disturbance. Older specimens will yield epigenomes more useful for comparison to those of modern counterparts.\n\n\n\nRaxworthy and Smith (2021)\n\n\n\n\nChallenges of working with hDNA\nThere are a lot of challenges to working with hDNA in general.\n\nContamination\nContamination with exogenous DNA (from an organism other than the specimen itself) can happen at any point during the collection, processing, transport, storage, or additional handling of the specimen.\n\n\nDNA degradation\nBoth dry- and wet-stored specimens stored at room temperature gradually lose high molecular weight DNA and overall DNA quantity over time. In addition, specimens stored in alcohol can suffer hydrolytic damage if alcohol concentration drops due to evaporative loss (which is a universal problem for large collections). For fixed specimens, formalin can cause cross-linkages between DNA and other protein/DNA molecules and cause increased DNA damage like deamination and depurination. (Raxworthy and Smith (2021))\n\n\nCytosine deamination\nParticularly relevant to this proposed project, DNA also undergoes cytosine deamination overtime. This is a spontaneous process in which cytosine residues are converted into uracil or hydroxyuracil. These are then observed as C-T and G-A transitions when deaminated cytosines are incorporated into a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Notably, while “unmethylated cytosines are deaminated into uracils, causing CpG → UpG modifications; methylated cytosines, on the other hand, are deaminated into thymines at a faster pace, which results in CpG → TpG patterns.” (Niiranen et al. (2022))\nThis is super important in the consideration of hDNA for DNA methylation work, because the methods we use to map DNA methylation also use a CpG → UpG modification. The most common tool used to map DNA methylation is Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), which converts unmethylated cytosines into uracils, which are then sequenced as thymine (CpG → UpG → TpG). Remaining CpGs represent the methylated cytosines of the original sequence. That means deaminated cytosines, either methylated or unmethylated, would appear to be unmethylated following WGBS since all deaminated cytosines would ultimately be sequenced as TpG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat is the timescale of cytosine deamination? Would specimens 100-200 years old have experienced sufficient cytosine deamination to significantly affect methylation mapping? How does the answer to this vary across preservation mediums (dry, alcohol, formalin)?\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious methylation work using hDNA\nI’ve only found one paper so far that has trialed hDNA methylation mapping, and the authors also conclude they are the only example (at the time of publishing, in 2019).\nRubi, Knowles, and Dantzer (2020)\n\n75 specimens of mice (40 white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis) and 35 woodland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis))\ntraditional museum skull preparations (dried skulls stored at room temperature)\nCollected in same locality in Menominee county, Michigan, over three collecting periods spanning 76 years (1940, 2003, and 2013–2016)\n\n\n\n\nRaxworthy and Smith (2021)\n\n\n\nFor the older specimens (13yo and 76yo), improved sequencing results decreased quickly past 5X read depth. In other words, while 5X depthwas a big improvement on 1X, 10X depth was not much different from 5X. This suggests that higher sequencing depth is important when working with old material, but has diminishing returns.\nInterestingly, while the youngest specimens (0-3yo) yielded much higher global methylation rates than the older groups (13yo and 76yo), the two older groups did not have significantly different global methylation rates. So while new material is much more successful, past ~10 years all older material has similar global methylation rates?\nRegional methylation patterns did not differ significantly due to specimen age\nThere was no notable signal of read end deamination. However, this may be the result of including a double digestion step, which cleaves DNA at both ends and may have “cut off” the more highly deaminated read ends. The slightly reduced global methylation rate of the 76yo group, in comparison to the 0-3 yo group, may indicate cytosine deamination in the oldest group.\nRecommends steps to reduce sequencing of deaminated sites (e.g. a double-digestions step, as included in this study, or uracil-DNA-glycosylase and endonuclease VIII, which can be used to remove uracils prior to bisulfite treatment, preventing the sequencing of unmethylated cystosines that have been deaminated into uracil)\nRecommendations for increasing yield from historic specimens:\n\nReduce size selection window to compensate for DNA fragmentation. Note that, while selecting smaller fragments would increase yield, it may also reduce the number of homologous loci sequenced across individuals, which may reduce ability to compare methylation patterns if sample size is low.\nSteps to minimize DNA degradation during bisulfite treatment, e.g. shortening bisulfite incubation time. Note, however, that this could also reduce conversion efficiency.\nCould remove the double digestion step, as this may have contributed to DNA fragmentation issues. Note, however, that this may lead to more issues with read-end deamination signal, as discussed above\n\n\n\n\nMethods for DNA methylation mapping\nChatGPT Summary:\nHere’s a comparison of different methylation mapping tools/methods based on cost, suitability for degraded/low-quantity DNA, use with partial cytosine deamination, and how established the method is:\n\nWhole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS)\n\nCost: High. WGBS sequences the entire genome after bisulfite treatment, making it the most expensive option due to the amount of sequencing required.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: Less suited for highly degraded DNA or very low quantities due to the need for large amounts of starting material and good quality DNA.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: WGBS relies on bisulfite treatment, which deaminates unmethylated cytosines to uracil (later read as thymine). Partial deamination could lead to incomplete conversion, impacting accuracy.\nHow well established: Very well established. WGBS is considered the gold standard for methylome analysis, providing comprehensive genome-wide methylation data.\n\n\n\nTargeted Bisulfite Sequencing (Targeted BS)\n\nCost: Moderate to high, depending on the number of regions targeted. It is more cost-effective than WGBS since only specific regions are sequenced.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: Better suited for degraded or low-quantity DNA compared to WGBS because it focuses on specific regions, requiring less input material.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: Similar to WGBS, it relies on bisulfite conversion, so incomplete conversion can affect results. However, focusing on smaller regions may allow more control and validation of conversion efficiency.\nHow well established: Well established. Targeted BS is widely used for focused methylation studies, especially in candidate regions like promoters or CpG islands.\n\n\n\nEnzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-Seq)\n\nCost: Moderate. EM-Seq offers a more cost-effective alternative to WGBS with a similar level of genomic coverage but without bisulfite treatment.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: More suitable than WGBS for degraded or low-quantity DNA because it uses an enzyme-based approach that is gentler than harsh bisulfite treatment.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: EM-Seq avoids bisulfite-induced cytosine deamination by using enzymatic conversion, making it ideal when bisulfite’s harsh chemical treatment might cause issues, including incomplete conversion.\nHow well established: Relatively new. EM-Seq is a promising alternative to bisulfite-based methods but is not yet as widely adopted as WGBS or Targeted BS.\n\n\n\nTarget Enriched EM-Seq\n\nCost: Moderate, less than WGBS but more than basic bisulfite methods.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: More suited for degraded DNA since the enzyme-based method is gentler.\nPartial cytosine deamination: Avoids bisulfite-induced damage, reducing errors tied to incomplete deamination.\nHow established: New but growing in popularity as an alternative to bisulfite sequencing, especially for focused regions.\n\n\n\nUracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG) Treatment\n\nCost: Variable, typically added on to bisulfite sequencing workflows (e.g., WGBS or Targeted BS).\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: UDG treatment is part of a preprocessing step to improve the accuracy of bisulfite sequencing but does not make it inherently better for degraded/low-quantity DNA.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: UDG treatment improves bisulfite sequencing by removing uracils generated from deaminated cytosines, which helps prevent errors from cytosine deamination that occur before bisulfite treatment. This leads to more accurate differentiation between methylated and unmethylated cytosines.\nHow well established: Well established, but UDG treatment is typically used in combination with other methods (e.g., WGBS) to improve accuracy rather than being a standalone method.\n\n\n\nMethylation-Sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (MS-AFLP)\n\nCost: Low to moderate. MS-AFLP is a more affordable technique compared to sequencing-based approaches.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: More suitable for degraded or low-quantity DNA, as it is based on PCR amplification and restriction digestion, which requires less starting material than sequencing-based approaches.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: MS-AFLP does not use bisulfite treatment, so partial deamination is not an issue. However, it depends on restriction enzymes sensitive to methylation status, so results can be impacted by incomplete digestion.\nHow well established: Long established but less widely used in high-resolution methylation studies compared to sequencing methods like WGBS. It’s an older method useful for specific applications, such as detecting overall methylation patterns or comparing methylation between samples.\n\n\n\nMethylated CpG Binding Domain Sequencing (MBD-seq)\n\nCost: Moderate. MBD-seq involves selective enrichment of methylated DNA, followed by sequencing, making it less expensive than whole-genome methods like WGBS but potentially more expensive than targeted approaches depending on the depth of sequencing required.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: More tolerant of low-quantity DNA than WGBS, but highly degraded DNA can be problematic, as larger fragments are better for efficient methylated DNA capture.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: Not impacted by cytosine deamination because MBD-seq relies on binding to methylated CpG sites via a protein domain, not on chemical conversion. This makes it more robust when bisulfite-induced errors might be an issue.\nHow well established: Well established, though less commonly used than bisulfite sequencing-based methods like WGBS. MBD-seq is often used for cost-effective, genome-wide methylation profiling without full bisulfite sequencing.\n\n\n\nMethylRAD\n\nCost: Low to moderate. MethylRAD uses methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to digest and sequence methylated DNA regions, making it more cost-effective than sequencing-based approaches that require bisulfite conversion or whole-genome coverage.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: Suitable for low-quantity DNA because it relies on restriction digestion and PCR amplification, but highly degraded DNA may still cause issues if fragments are too short to be efficiently digested.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: Not affected by cytosine deamination since MethylRAD does not use bisulfite treatment. Instead, it depends on restriction enzyme sensitivity to methylation, so it avoids issues related to incomplete bisulfite conversion.\nHow well established: Relatively new but gaining traction. It’s not as widely adopted as WGBS but is becoming a popular, cost-effective alternative for methylation analysis, particularly for comparative methylation studies.\n\n\n\nComparison Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nCost\nDegraded/Low-Quantity DNA\nPartial Cytosine Deamination\nHow Established\n\n\n\n\nWGBS\nHigh\nLess suitable\nSensitive to incomplete conversion\nGold standard, very well established\n\n\nTargeted BS\nModerate\nBetter suited\nSensitive to incomplete conversion\nWell established\n\n\nEM-Seq\nModerate\nSuitable\nAvoids bisulfite-induced damage\nNewer, gaining popularity\n\n\nTarget Enriched EM-Seq\nModerate\nSuitable\nAvoids bisulfite-induced damage\nNewer, promising\n\n\nUDG Treatment (w/BS)\nVariable\nNeutral impact\nImproves bisulfite accuracy\nWell established with WGBS\n\n\nMS-AFLP\nLow/Moderate\nSuitable\nNot impacted by deamination\nOlder, less common\n\n\nMBD-seq\nModerate\nSuitable for low-quantity, less for degraded\nNot impacted\nWell established but less common\n\n\nMethylRAD\nLow/Moderate\nSuitable, but not ideal for highly degraded DNA\nNot impacted\nNewer, cost-effective, growing\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nCost: WGBS remains the most expensive method, while MethylRAD and MS-AFLP are among the least expensive. MBD-seq is a mid-range option that provides genome-wide methylation information without full sequencing.\nDegraded/low-quantity DNA: MethylRAD and MBD-seq handle low-quantity DNA better than WGBS, but highly degraded samples may still present challenges for both.\nPartial cytosine deamination: MBD-seq and MethylRAD are unaffected by partial cytosine deamination because they don’t rely on bisulfite conversion.\nHow established: WGBS is the gold standard, while MBD-seq is a well-established alternative for methylation profiling. MethylRAD is newer but growing in popularity due to its cost-effectiveness and potential for comparative studies.\n\n\n\n\nNanopore Sequencing\nAn option that Steven mentioned as potentially useful is Nanopore sequencing. In this method, DNA (or RNA) molecules are fed through a nanopore, a tiny hole embedded in a membrane that separates two chambers of electrolyte solution. When a voltage is applied, an enzyme pushes the DNA molecule through the nanopore and fluctuations in the electric current are tracked. Specialized software can then be used to assign nucleotide at each position based on the current fluctuations.\nWhile Nanopore sequencing was originally developed for standard DNA sequencing, softwares have been developed that can interpret Nanopore read data to identify methylated nucleotides (e.g., Ahsan et al. (2024)). This has many advantages over WGBS that could be really useful for working with hDNA.\nAs a reminder, the biggest hurdles when working with hDNA are likely to be 1) low DNA quantity, and 2) low DNA quality, including spontaneous cytosine deamination that converts CpG sites to either UpGs (unmethylated) or TpGs (methylated). Nanopore sequencing reads and detects nucleotides from a single DNA molecule at a time, meaning it works with much lower quantities of DNA than traditional sequencing methods. This also means that DNA amplification (i.e., PCR) is not required, so there are no biases introduced prior to sequencing. In addition, since Nanopore sequencing requires no modification of the DNA (e.g., bisulfite conversion), there is no introduced deamination, meaning deaminated cytosines will not be confused with intact methylated and unmethylated cytosines. Finally, as the cherry on top, Oxford Nanopore Technologies announced just a few months ago that they now have “the ability to detect damaged DNA bases, including genomic Uracil (dU) at 96.34% accuracy.” This means that, not only will Nanopore sequencing distinguish between intact and deaminated cytosines, it should be able to differentiate between deaminated cytosines (deaminated CpG → UpG) and deaminated methylated cytosines (CpG → TpG)!\nI couldn’t find a description of the analysis changes that allow ONT to detect damaged DNA, but if that update is not yet publicly available, I also found a paper describing how to detect Uracil in DNA Békési et al. (2021), which would similarly allow you to discriminate cytosine deamination of methylated and unmethylated cytosine.\n\n\nNotes for SIFP project:\n\nIf I’m trying to do a validation-type paper, which might hold the most water given how little hDNA methylation work has been done, would be best to use specimens of same species, collected from same location over multiple time points (ideally same reef).\nSeems like big concerns are dealing with fragmented DNA and cytosine deamination. EM-Seq seems like the best option for addressing both of those, and it may be abit cheaper than WGBS! Only downside is that it’s not as well established, so I’m not sure how that might affect data analysis (are there existing tools?) or reporting/interpreting results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAhsan, Mian Umair, Anagha Gouru, Joe Chan, Wanding Zhou, and Kai Wang. 2024. “A Signal Processing and Deep Learning Framework for Methylation Detection Using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing.” Nature Communications 15 (1): 1448. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45778-y.\n\n\nBékési, Angéla, Eszter Holub, Hajnalka Laura Pálinkás, and Beáta G.

    "text": "As I’ve started reading more and more papers over the last few months I’ve been thinking more about how to keep track of all the information input. I’m still in the early stages of my projects, so it’s difficult to know exactly which papers might be useful for future project planning, lit reviews, writing, etc. I recently started using a new method to organize all of my papers, so I thought I’d share!\n\nStep 1: Zotero\nI started using the reference manager Zotero in December and I really like being able to annotate papers, generate notes, and assign tags. My workflow when I find a new paper I’m interested in is to first read the abstract, add the paper to my Zotero library, and assign tags related to how I might plan on using the paper (e.g. species name, relevant methods) . I also always assign the tag “unread,” and then change it to “read” once I’ve finished reading/annotating.\nHowever, Zotero doesn’t have an easy way to view the tags, notes, or some types of metadata associated with multiple papers at the same time. Since I’m a very visual person, I want a way to view, sort, and search the key information from all of my papers at the same time. After asking for suggestions in the lab Slack, Chris sent me a Sheets template that I’ve been testing out!\n\n\nStep 2: Google Sheets\nOriginal template (from Chris)\nMy current document\nMy current setup for this document looks like this:\n\n\nThe metadata recorded in the Sheets document is a little redundant because all of my papers are already stored in my Zotero library, but it ensures I’m recording information for the right paper.\nHere’s a look at all of the options for the different categorical variables:\n\n\nWith these options I can search by project, study type, and relevance, and keep track of how thoroughly I’ve read a source in my library.\nI’m still in the early stages of implementing this document, but so far I really like it! While I was brainstorming the oyster project experimental design I had to reference a few papers and the Sheets document made it much easier to quickly go through many papers and the information I’d identified as most helpful, without having to individually click on each paper to view its associated metadata/notes. I still need to transfer everything i currently have in my Zotero library to the Sheets doc, but I think having this system in place before I really get into the weeds of reading dozens/hundreds of papers for thesis writing will be super helpful!"

Interesting to think about possible epigenetic mismatch of gametes…\nstudy set of multiple stressors and/or multiple generations on methylation/expression/phenotype/etc. (e.g. Feiner et al. 2022, set of chemical and thermal environmental stressors on daphnia to investigate epigenetic heritability)\nIn same daphnia paper (Feiner er al. 2022), saw responses to naturally occurring stressors were more inherited than those to non-naturally occurring ones — possible suggestion of underlying preadaptation towards certain epigenetic modifications that helps allow them to be passed on successfully and retained?\nkeep in mind MHW conditions (sudden dramatic swings), not just slow warming creep of climate crisis\nIf epigeneitc modification is heritable, what are epigenetic impacts of releasing captive/bred stock back into wild?\nIs it possible to study gene expression/methylation/ncRNA in ancient DNA?

    "text": "Questions\n\nNeed to look more into epigenetic reprogramming – how does it work, mechanistically? How does it differ among taxa, especially between model organisms and inverts? How would it differ among sexual reproduction and the many forms of asexual reproduction?\nHeritability of ncRNA-related epigenetic changes?\nWhile reading George et al. 2023, I noticed they used heat shock to induce triploidy in their Pacific oysters (referenced Yamamoto et al. 1988, which showed you can apply a heat shock of 35*C to 20*C-acclimated larvae during meiosis to induce triploidy). Raised the question of whether this can/does happen in the wild? And if it’s possible to achieve triploidy-inducing heat shock conditions in the wild, does that mean that climate change/increased incidence of MHW will begin shifting wild oyster populations to more triploids, and thus affect fertility/reproductive viability of wild pops?\nA common way of producing triploid oyster stocks nowadays is crossing tetraploid and diploid oysters (genertes 100% triploid offspring without the mortality associated with heat-shock or chemically induced triploidy). We know that induced-triploids are less robust to temperature/aerial exposure stress than diploids (George et al. 2023). Is it possible that, in induced triploids, the heat/chemical shock at an early life stage epigenetically “primes” them poorly? Epigenetic modifications and genetic adaptations to stress are heritable, though, so how do tetraploidXdiploid triploids fare under stress conditions, and can this be modulated by the acclimation/adaptation of the parents?\nDuring some preliminary lit review on Pacific cod and MHW related mortality, I read that overall warming and early-year MHWs can affect the timing of marine primary production (e.g. phytoplankton reproduction and abundance). Oysters feed on phytoplankton through filter feeding – does that mean that, as oceans warm, oysters may be facing more starvation stress? Especially if there ends up being a “mismatch” of spawning and primary production?\nDoes polyploidy affect the way you analyze and compare gene expression data? Since a triploid would have an extra set of chromosomes, could that affect number of transcripts even if [# transcripts expressed per chromosome] didnt change?"

So far they haven’t seen any direct effect on the anemone host or anemone fertility/reproduction, which we might normally expect based on role of estrogen in vertebrates. There was, however, a significant effect on the symbiont populations – in presence of estrogen, symbionts were increasingly photosynthetically efficient – woah! The effect was so strong that they could actually see differences in the color of the water the anemones were held in because of increased levels of algae in the water. Increasing estrogen levels led to this gradient of increasingly green water 😮. Also touched on studying impact of sediment suspension (affects symbiont productivity and/or polyp feeding?)\nWe also talked a bit about the possibility of coral polyps in the same aggregate colony sharing the “symbiont load,” and related nutrients, which could explain when some species have “patchy” symbiont distribution around colony. Apparently there’s a kind of plant that grows in/near salty water and, to rid itself of excess salt, basically picks a leaf to die and sends all the salt there, leaving the rest of the plant healthy. Maybe similar stuff happens in corals?"

Basically, maybe the combination of MHW and differing egg/sperm developmental timelines are causing egg/sperm mismatch when spawning happens!\nEggs take a long time to develop and start in late summer, and thus are already in development during MHW/bleaching events. Sperm, however, as “cheap” and don’t start developing until March, so never experience bleaching before the spawning season in early summer. That means that, during spawning, you can end up with bleaching-affected eggs trying to match with unstressed sperm – maybe that “mismatch” is causing problems!\nBred bleached (B) and non-bleached (NB) corals. Found that BxB corals and NBxNB corals were most successful in larval development, while BxNB and NBxB corals didn’t do as well. Support for this possible mismatch problem\nWhile I’m sure this is at least partially because of bleaching-related stress effects of the viability of the eggs or something similar, this is making me think about the possible role of epigenetics here. We know that environmental conditions can be associated with epigenetic modifications like methylation, and that such epigenetic modifications can also take place in the gametes and thus become heritable. Is it possible that there are epigenetic modifications happening in the eggs during these bleaching events that are not happening to the sperm, and that this “mismatch” of the epigenome is less successful that the combination of two stress-modified gametes (BxB) or of two non-modified gametes (NBxNB)?\n\nAssessing physiological and molecular plasticity in the early stages of Porites astreoides (Florence Fields)\nIntraspecific variation in thermal tolerance in the endangered Caribbean coral, Acropora palmata (Holland Elder)\n\nKeep in mind bleaching, like other stress reponses, is continuous, not binary!\n\nThe butterfly(fish) effect: Using Caetodontidae territories as bioindicators (Corrine Avidan)\nMicrobial predictors of bleacing in Great Barrier Reef Acropora millepora (Karim Primov)\nIron wars over ligand soup: Exploring chemical crosstalk in Symbiodiniaceae-bacteria interactions (Hannah Reich)\n\nBacteria can help eukaryotic partners (like algae) access hard-to-get iron\nPossible connection here to Callum’s talk about impacts of heavy metal contamination on coral/holobiont?\n\nEnvironmental drivers of coral-associated algal and microbial communities across multiple scales (Coleen Bove)"

Normalized counts are most useful for things like visualizing expression levels and differential expression analysis.\nSecond is variance stabilizing the counts data, which aims to make the variance of the transformed data approximately independent of the mean, reducing heteroscedasticity (the relationship between variance and mean) and “smoothing” out the variance at low counts. Notably, the transformed data is no longer on the original count scale. The transformation makes the variance roughly constant across the range of counts, which makes it easier to interpret patterns in the data visually. Variance stabilized data is most useful for exploratory data analysis, like PCA, clustering, and heatmaps, and is also the transformation we’ll want to use before WGCNA.\n\n# extract normalized counts # (normalization is automatically performed by deseq2) Apul_counts_RNA_norm &lt;- counts(dds_Apul_RNA, normalized=TRUE) %&gt;% data.frame()  write.table(Apul_counts_RNA_norm, file = \"../output/03.01-Apul-RNA-summary-Hisat/Apul_counts_RNA_normalized.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE, quote = FALSE)   # variance stabilized data vsd_Apul_RNA &lt;- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds_Apul_RNA, blind=TRUE) wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA &lt;- getVarianceStabilizedData(dds_Apul_RNA) rv_wpn_Apul_RNA &lt;- rowVars(wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA, useNames=TRUE)  Apul_counts_RNA_vsd &lt;- data.frame(wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA) write.table(Apul_counts_RNA_vsd, file = \"../output/03.01-Apul-RNA-summary-Hisat/Apul_counts_RNA_variancestabilized.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE,quote = FALSE)  q75_wpn_Apul_RNA &lt;- quantile(rowVars(wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA, useNames=TRUE), .75)  # 75th quantile variability Apul_counts_RNA_vsd_q75 &lt;- wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA[ rv_wpn_Apul_RNA &gt; q75_wpn_Apul_RNA, ] %&gt;% data.frame # filter to retain only the most variable genes write.table(Apul_counts_RNA_vsd_q75, file = \"../output/03.01-Apul-RNA-summary-Hisat/Apul_counts_RNA_variancestabilized_q75.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE,quote = FALSE)  q95_wpn_Apul_RNA &lt;- quantile(rowVars(wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA, useNames=TRUE), .95)  # 95th quantile variability Apul_counts_RNA_vsd_q95 &lt;- wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA[ rv_wpn_Apul_RNA &gt; q95_wpn_Apul_RNA, ] %&gt;% data.frame # filter to retain only the most variable genes write.table(Apul_counts_RNA_vsd_q95, file = \"../output/03.01-Apul-RNA-summary-Hisat/Apul_counts_RNA_variancestabilized_q95.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE,quote = FALSE)"

Normalized counts are most useful for things like visualizing expression levels and differential expression analysis.\nVariance stabilization aims to make the variance of the transformed data approximately independent of the mean, reducing heteroscedasticity (the relationship between variance and mean) and “smoothing” out the variance at low counts. Notably, the transformed data is no longer on the original count scale. The transformation makes the variance roughly constant across the range of counts, which makes it easier to interpret patterns in the data visually. Variance stabilized data is most useful for exploratory data analysis, like PCA, clustering, and heatmaps, and is also the transformation we’ll want to use before WGCNA.\nHere’s some of the figures generated in these summary docs"

    "title": "ShortStack: mature vs. star sequences incorrect?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "See E5 deep-dive Github issue #49\nWhile looking at ShortStack database matches, for the three species I realized that all three have matches to multiple published sequences of miR-2030, but miR-2030 was not one of the miRNAs identified as conserved between the three species. After poking around I realized that the Apul miR-2030 miRNA and Peve miR-2030 have identical mature miRNA sequences, but the Pmea miR-2030 has a totally different mature sequence. Instead, the star sequence of Pmea miR-2030 matches the mature sequences for Apul miR-2030 and Peve miR-2030. This raises the possibility that ShortStack is incorrectly distinguishing between mature and star sequences, which would throw a bit of a wrench in the current workflow to identify conserved miRNAs. I also noted something similar when comparing ShortStack outputs to the miRdeep2 output.\n\n\nAs a reminder, miRNAs originate as primary miRNA transcripts (“pri-miRNAs”) transcribed from genes, which are characteristically folded in a “hairpin” structure. These pri-miRNAs are then cleaved at their base to form precursor miRNAs (“pre-miRNAs”). The pre-miRNA loop is then removed by Dicer, leaving a mature miRNA duplex. Both of these strands (5’ and 3’) can be loaded into an Argonaute (AGO) protein complex to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which then guides gene expression. However, one strand is usually preferentially loaded, in part based on its thermodynamic stability. Strands that are not loaded are unwound from their complement and generally degraded by cellular machinery. The preferentially-loaded strand is commonly titled the “mature miRNA,” while the unloaded strand is commonly called the “miRNA*” or “miRNA star”. Since the AGO-loaded strand (mature miRNA) is the one that actually influences gene expression, this is the strand that is considered important during miRNA identification and analysis. (Summarized from (O’Brien et al. 2018))\n\n\n\nmiRNA biogenisis (Tomari and Zamore 2005)\n\n\nIt isn’t entirely clear from the ShortStack documentation how it distinguishes between mature and star sequences. What sequence features would indicate one strand is more likely to be loaded on to the RISC complex than the other? In addition, O’Brien et al. (2018) seem to suggest that both the mature and star miRNA molecules could play some role in gene expression – does that mean we should be considering both to be important?\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nO’Brien, Jacob, Heyam Hayder, Yara Zayed, and Chun Peng. 2018. “Overview of MicroRNA Biogenesis, Mechanisms of Actions, and Circulation.” Frontiers in Endocrinology 9 (August): 402. https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2018.00402.\n\n\nTomari, Yukihide, and Phillip D.

In this step, kallisto takes your reference transcriptome as input and breaks each transcript into “k-mers,” or shorter sequences that are k nucleotides long. It then “indexes” these k-mers, storing each k-mer and its transcript association in a data structure for more efficient retrieval during the pseudoalignment step.\n\n\nSample quantification\nNext is quantification, which take both the index you just constructed and your trimmed RNAseq read, and makes use of pseudoalignment, a process that is much faster and more efficient than aligning each full read to a full transcript. Briefly, each read is broken up into k-mers, which are then mapped to the index to see which indexed transcript k-mers may match the read k-mers. Kallisto then calculates a probability score for each read/transcript pair, evaluating the likelihood that a given read originated from each transcript. These scores are then used to estimate transcript abundance.\n\n\nBuild count matrix for all samples\nThe kallisto quantification process can only take one sample (i.e., one pair of reads) at a time, so as a last step we build a counts matrix that lists the transcript abundances for all of our samples in a single file.\n\n\nSummary\nA. pulchra:\nsample 140 – 47M reads processed (61.4% mapped)\nsample 145 – 42M reads processed (65.3% mapped)\nsample 150 – 43M reads processed (47.0% mapped)\nsample 173 – 47M reads processed (60.7% mapped)\nsample 178 – 42M reads processed (59.3% mapped)\n\nP. evermanni:\nsample 71 – 50M reads processed (35.3% mapped)\nsample 73 – 51M reads processed (29.8% mapped)\nsample 76 – 49M reads processed (35.6% mapped)\nsample 79 – 49M reads processed (31.9% mapped)\nsample 82 – 48M reads processed (37.3% mapped)\nP. meandrina:\nsample 47 – 54M reads processed (26.1% mapped)\nsample 48 – 51M reads processed (25.3% mapped)\nsample 50 – 55M reads processed (31.1% mapped)\nsample 53 – 53M reads processed (31.8% mapped)\nsample 57 – 42M reads processed (21.7% mapped)"

I worked a logged-total of 45.5 hrs this week, spending 15hrs on classes, 22.5hrs on TAing, and 8hrs on thesis stuff. The breakdown could definitely be adjusted. I expect to spend significantly less time on TAing after this first week, as students require less assistance for basic R tasks, and as the course site requires less setup/maintainance. I should spend more time on classes, particularly FISH315 research, and thesis work."

It wouldn’t work perfectly just subbing in a different list of sequences to current workflow. Star sequences are getting blast hits to the sets of stars associated with already known conserved mature miRNAs, and I’m not exactly sure how I might want to change the filtering to get what I want. After manually investigating it in Google sheets though, it looks like including star sequences wouldn’t have a huge impact. Instead of 4 miRNAs conserved in all three species and 1/1/1 for each pair of species, including stars as possible mature miRNA sequences would shift the conserved counts to 5 miRNAs in all three species and 0/1/1 for the Apul-Peve, Apul-Pmea, and Peve-Pmea pairs."

How can you get useful/trustworthy information by comparing your data to itsself…?\n^in effort to make sense of above question I made a quick sketch – I think it’s something like this? I realized that I forgot (for the nth time) that I’m working with RNA now, not DNA, so there are multiple copies of every sequenced transcript, and for DGE work the relative abundances of the transcripts, rather than presence/absence, is what matters.\n\nFeeling very dumb and confused about the minutia of how to do the deep dive gene expression stuff so switched back to a generic DGE pipeline in preparation for the cod samples.

We have trimmed RNAseq reads for the three species but we couldn’t find any published transcriptomes. However, for P.meandrina we found NCBI published gff files with only annotated protein-coding genes, which could maybe be used to approximate a transcriptome file? We’re not sure if that work correctly with kallisto though, or if we’d still need to use HiSat…\nRead up on some of the sncRNA tools we used to write up on them in the deep dive manuscript (loving how it takes like 40min of reading to write 1 summary sentence of how something works)."

Triploid summer mortality is the big concern, so it would be useful to have some way to “diagnose” stress in the field, informing farms when/how they need to adjust their setups to avoid mass mortality (e.g., adding feed, moving bags to reduce density, shifting to cooler waters, bring into hatchery(?), etc.). Stress “priming” is also a way that hatcheries could preemptively prepare stock for stressful events. Maybe a cool tweak to the project would be to start with diploid/triploid larvae, prime some (but not others), raise to adulthood, and outplant to see how they do in the field. Throughout, measure some set of physiological features (e.g., respiration) to quantify stress and try to develop some assay of biomarkers indicative of stress/impending mortality. Could still do temp and nutrition stress\nI also really like the idea that Sarah suggested about making notebook posts for specific topics when I do a deep dive into the literature on a specific thing, plus her notebook has some really cool features, so I think I’m going to try to implement some of those!"

Probably doesn’t affect end result of kallisto much, since it’s pseudoaligning full reads, but still need to fix it. Should be a straightforward fix, the biggest pain will be waiting another 4 hours for the adjusted transcriptome generation code to run again😭\nDid a quick and dirty test using both a gff and a bed file as input to bedtools getfasta and both resulted in the same output, suggesting bedtools does appropriately differentiate between the formats! I’ll still convert to bed before generating the P.evermanni transcriptome though, just in case"

It ran much quicker this time around and resulted in a much smaller output file, which means one of the two times I ran the script something was wrong.

For mice/rats shown to persist 6-7 generations, but will definitely vary among taxa. Lab works with species with longerish generations, so has only really gone out to F2 (second generation)\n\nWhat about acclimatization related to microbiome?

I was also able to log in to my new Gannet account and get it set up, so I should (theoretically) be able to store large files there now. I’m still not 100 sure how I would do that though. I’ve read through some old Github issues and stuff and I think I’d need to either ssh or rsync to connect to Gannet from Raven and then copy over the large files using that connection. I’m not not familiar with rsync, so I’m not sure what the difference between ssh and rsync is or which is preferable. I also am not 100% sure what the server host name/IP address would be to ssh into Gannet, but I’m guessing I can use the IP that Gannet emailed to me. Since I’m not confident in correctly connecting and copying to Gannet from Raven I haven’t uploaded the blast/annotation output files or pushed anything from running the rmd to github. I’ll either ask about it in lab tomorrow or Science Hour on Friday.\nI’m also still not sure what a lot of the code from Steven’s blast/annotation code is doing, so I want to do a deep-dive into the commands being run.\nLastly, I finally took a moment to try registering for SICB only to find out I don’t have access to the College of Environment purchasing system, Treq. I requested access through the indicated email and will ask about it during Friday Science Hour if I don’t hear back by then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several weeks of accumulating issues with running command line and working in RStudio/Github (both locally and on Raven), I think I’ve finally resolved them all! I was able to run the tutorial blast code successfully (I think). I still want to figure out/ask about the function of all the parameters called (e.g. -evalue 1E-20), and to figure out how to interpret the output results (or at least learn how to identify possible issues in the output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevelations from lab meeting today! Several of my Raven problems were solved during our raven/github-focused meeting today – notes below:\n\nConnecting Raven with my Github. I needed to enter\n```{bash} git config –global user.email \"[mygithubemailthatIdon'twanttopublicize]\"   git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"```\nand then log in to git using my username and a personal access token (which I have now created). I’m now fully connected to github from Raven and have successfully pushed/pulled!\nGetting/accessing ncbi blast software on Raven. Blast is indeed already downloaded and accessible on Raven, it’s just in a higher-level directory that I couldn’t find because I didn’t know about it (I can only default view my home directory on Raven). The higher-level lab directory is /home/shared, and ncbi-blast v. 2.12.0 is already installed there!\nPushing large files to Github. Don’t! Any file (e.g. output file) sizes larger than 100MB should not be pushed to Github - instead, put it on Gannet (another lab server intended for large-file-size data and output storage). Already github-issued Sam/Steven to ask for access to Gannet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter fairly continuous head-bashing (pun intended ;) ) with RStudio/bash/blast for the last two weeks I’m kind of tired of it, so today I’m going to focus on other stuff – like setting some goals! I’ve had ~3 weeks now to get settled into the lab and Steven and I have had the chance to talk about possible directions for the near future, so let’s put some stuff in writing – see October Goals post for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI continued trying to figure out how to work in Raven today and ran into another fun problem – my Raven RStudio isn’t connected to my github, even though I copied the directory I’m working in directly from Github in the same way I would copy a repo to RStudio on my local machine. I realized I wasn’t able to commit or push/pull, and using the command ```{bash} git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"``` didn’t fix the issue. It clearly isn’t an issue with my shell script/terminal because I’ve been successfully running command line code on Raven. Maybe Raven isn’t supposed to end up tied to github? I would think the code and stuff should all end up on github for backup/reproducibility purposes, but I can also see why sending some things to github (e.g. output files) could require an unreasonable amount of storage…\nI also managed to modify the 001-blast.Rmd tutorial script to download a windows version of ncbi blast to Raven and run the .exe, but I wasn’t able to successfully access the blast.exe component used in the first task of the tutorial file (setting blast directory). Neither I nor google can figure out why with a cursory search and I unfortunately have class soon, but in the worst case I can bring this up at lab meeting on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam was able to resend me login credentials for Raven (the Lab’s primary server, implemented through a browser version of RStudio), so I started getting situated on it. Since I have a pending task related to blasting a cod transcriptome, I copied over my github repo RobertsLab_OnboardingTasks and took another look at the blast tutorial .Rmd file (001-blast.Rmd). The last time I tried to run this tutorial file (on RStudio locally) I ran into problems running bash through RStudio at all.\nThankfully that isn’t an issue working in Raven, but now I’m kind of stumped because of the need to download and run blast. I can’t find any “higher level” directories above my own Raven account that might hold relevant software like ncbi-blast, but it seems weird that I’d need to individually download the software for use on a shared server…The code included in the tutorial file for this also wouldn’t work on my machine, since it’s written with Mac-specific and outdated versions of blast. I downloaded the most recent Windows version of blast to my local machine, but I don’t think I can access local software from Raven since it’s a server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finished the cod temp/growth analysis assigned by Steven\n\n\n\nI’m still having issues with the disconnect between which shell script is being used by my terminal and which is used by console in R. We realized today that my problems pushing my analysis code to the lab’s project-cod-temperature repo on github were related to the disconnect problem. I was able to pull and push to github when I was working within the repo on RStudio, but I couldn’t commit using the Git environment in the upper right pane. However, pushing, pulling, and committing manually from the terminal all worked fine. We think that, somehow, the commit action in the Git environment is using the same faulty WSL shell that my console is defaulting to, even though the push/pull actions are correctly defaulting to Git Bash. To make matters even more confusing, when I’m working within my lab notebook repo in RStudio I’m able to push, pull, and commit successfully from the Git environment with no issues. Why is my default shell script for console/some parts of git different between repos/RStudio projects?\nNo answers yet, but for right now I’m still able to maintain functionality while working locally because the terminal is functioning appropriately and I have a workaround to run bash code chunks included in Rmd files (see Oct.12 post).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I may have fixed the issue running bash code chunks in Rmd files! Included the following:\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(bash='C:/Program Files/Git/git-bash.exe'))\n\nAnd now, while I still don’t seem to get any output when I try to run individual code chunks by pressing the “play” button in the top right corner, knitting the document works! I still haven’t figured out how to permanently set the default shell script for running bash code chunks from Rmd files (checking default shell using “Sys.which(”bash”)” from the console still returns “C::\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe” aka WSL), so for now I guess I’ll just have to include that YAML block in any Rmd file I’m working in.\nStarted working on cod temp/size data analysis assigned by Steven but haven’t been able to push to the lab Github repo (project-cod-temperature) bc, while I successfully cloned the repo to RStudio, I haven’t been able to connect them so I’m able to push changes back to it. Will ask about it during Science Hour tomorrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve continued trying to troubleshoot my issues with running bash code chunks in .Rmd files. Running Sys.which(“bash”) in the RStudio console the path “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe”, which I think is bash installed as a part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started looking at the github tasks Steven assigned me to familiarize me with Raven and the lab’s computing practices (analyzing some weight/temp data and BLASTing/annotating a transcriptome), but quickly ran into setup issues. I made a new github repo using the lab’s project template and tried running through one of the blast tutorials included in the project template, but immediately had problems with running the bash code chunks. I’ve done command-line data analysis work before, but never through an Rmarkdown file or in RStudio. When I tried to run any of the bash code chunks nothing would happen, not even an error output. First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin? I’ll try more troubleshooting tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted an additional employee training and went over my lit review questions (see Oct.5 entry) with Steven. Also github-issued Sam about getting added to Raven.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\n\nA: adenine is only methylated in certain taxa (e.g. bacteria), and isn’t methylated in marine inverts\n\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable? Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\nA: Differs among taxa. We have secondary evidence that it is in marine inverts. For taxa where there’s more evidence, modification has to happen during early developmental stages of gonads (presumably to alter the gamete cells). A lot of it is unknown though (similar for other forms of modification e.g. histone modification)\n\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 (Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation…)\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 studied polyploidy in oysters because of its common use in oyster aquaculture – does polyploidy have any potential conservation applications, particularly in eukaryotes, for whom ployploidy is often better tolerated? One scenario I can think of is intentional hybridization of two species to selectively breed a more resilient population – since polyploidy is more common in hybrids, may be important to understand its impacts. I also know polyploidy sometimes happens in corals (especially Caribbean corals), which can reproduce asexually fairly easily. (Need to read related paper Stephens et al. 2023 – w/ Putnam and Bhattacharya!)\n\nA: Since polyploidy reduces breeding potential so could be useful in conservation. But don;t have any information on relationship between polyploidy and methylation or the mechanisms of how polyploidy affects methylation\n\nConfused about a couple aspects of the experimental setup:\n\nStated that lab obtained 500 oysters for the experiment, but then states that the starting sample size of each of the six treatments (2 controls, 2 single stressor, 2 multiple stressors) was 112, which adds to way over 500 oysters\n\nA:\n\nFor the multiple stressors treatment, why was aerial exposure not repeated multiple times (since low tide happens on a regular daily schedule, not just once during a given warming event)?\n\nA: Don’t want to go overboard and kill all the oysters, so start out trying with less stressful stress conditions. Want to understand more than just the death outcome.\n\n\nIn Results, why is survival probability not the direct inverse of mortality?\n\nA: doesn’t know, maybe check supplemental materials or ask in Slack\n\nI think I noticed some typos… do you want to know about them or just leave it be?\n\nPutnam et al. 2023 (Dynamic DNA methylation contributes to carryover effects…)\n\nIn the results section I saw that shell area was used as a proxy for shell size – is it assumed that shell thickness remains fairly constant? Do we know this will hold during acidification? Also, are shell size and body mass tightly correlated? (I would assume so, but it would be interesting if acidic conditions messed with that relationship)\n\nA: Not assumed, but it wasn’t measured. Emma Tidman paper looks at effect of acidification on various measures of shell strength/size.\nA: Emma also looked at body mass/tissue impacts of acidification (but yes, there is generally a correlation between shell size and body mass)\n\nIn Fig.3 I’m a little confused about the y-axes of 3c and 3d – what is the baseline (the “1”) for these relative size values? It doesn’t seem like it could be original size (as in a and b)\n\nA: check supplemental\n\nWhat is the difference between differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs)? Are DMRs just methylation of non-coding DNA (e.g. introns)?\n\nA: Regions are just more broad than genes (so regions could contain genes). The scale (in terms of number of bp) goes loci -&gt; genes -&gt; regions.\n\nI have no idea what’s going on in figure 4 :(\n\nA: each cell represents gene and the z-score is basically showing a heatmap of gene expression. The “tree” looking thing is just showing clustering of individuals based on expression level.\n\nor figure 5\n\nA: Steven is also kind of confused about this rn, but check supplementals for more\n\nWhat are DEGs (pg12)? Also, are CpGs just cytosine/guanine pairs?\n\nDEG=Differentially expressed gene (rather than differentially methylated), and yes, CpGs are cytosine/guanine pairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued reading through recent lab publications (see entry from yesterday) and compiled some questions about them to ask Steven at Science Hour tomorrow (see below). I also completed the required HazCom training (and returned updated training documentation to Sam), requested access to the UW chemical inventory/safety system, and wrote and uploaded a personal description, lab notebook link, email, and picture, to the lab website.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable?

I was also able to log in to my new Gannet account and get it set up, so I should (theoretically) be able to store large files there now. I’m still not 100 sure how I would do that though. I’ve read through some old Github issues and stuff and I think I’d need to either ssh or rsync to connect to Gannet from Raven and then copy over the large files using that connection. I’m not not familiar with rsync, so I’m not sure what the difference between ssh and rsync is or which is preferable. I also am not 100% sure what the server host name/IP address would be to ssh into Gannet, but I’m guessing I can use the IP that Gannet emailed to me. Since I’m not confident in correctly connecting and copying to Gannet from Raven I haven’t uploaded the blast/annotation output files or pushed anything from running the rmd to github. I’ll either ask about it in lab tomorrow or Science Hour on Friday.\nI’m also still not sure what a lot of the code from Steven’s blast/annotation code is doing, so I want to do a deep-dive into the commands being run.\nLastly, I finally took a moment to try registering for SICB only to find out I don’t have access to the College of Environment purchasing system, Treq. I requested access through the indicated email and will ask about it during Friday Science Hour if I don’t hear back by then."

The higher-level lab directory is /home/shared, and ncbi-blast v. 2.12.0 is already installed there!\nPushing large files to Github. Don’t! Any file (e.g. output file) sizes larger than 100MB should not be pushed to Github - instead, put it on Gannet (another lab server intended for large-file-size data and output storage).

I realized I wasn’t able to commit or push/pull, and using the command ```{bash} git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"``` didn’t fix the issue. It clearly isn’t an issue with my shell script/terminal because I’ve been successfully running command line code on Raven. Maybe Raven isn’t supposed to end up tied to github? I would think the code and stuff should all end up on github for backup/reproducibility purposes, but I can also see why sending some things to github (e.g. output files) could require an unreasonable amount of storage…\nI also managed to modify the 001-blast.Rmd tutorial script to download a windows version of ncbi blast to Raven and run the .exe, but I wasn’t able to successfully access the blast.exe component used in the first task of the tutorial file (setting blast directory). Neither I nor google can figure out why with a cursory search and I unfortunately have class soon, but in the worst case I can bring this up at lab meeting on Thursday."

The last time I tried to run this tutorial file (on RStudio locally) I ran into problems running bash through RStudio at all.\nThankfully that isn’t an issue working in Raven, but now I’m kind of stumped because of the need to download and run blast. I can’t find any “higher level” directories above my own Raven account that might hold relevant software like ncbi-blast, but it seems weird that I’d need to individually download the software for use on a shared server…The code included in the tutorial file for this also wouldn’t work on my machine, since it’s written with Mac-specific and outdated versions of blast. I downloaded the most recent Windows version of blast to my local machine, but I don’t think I can access local software from Raven since it’s a server."

We realized today that my problems pushing my analysis code to the lab’s project-cod-temperature repo on github were related to the disconnect problem. I was able to pull and push to github when I was working within the repo on RStudio, but I couldn’t commit using the Git environment in the upper right pane. However, pushing, pulling, and committing manually from the terminal all worked fine. We think that, somehow, the commit action in the Git environment is using the same faulty WSL shell that my console is defaulting to, even though the push/pull actions are correctly defaulting to Git Bash. To make matters even more confusing, when I’m working within my lab notebook repo in RStudio I’m able to push, pull, and commit successfully from the Git environment with no issues. Why is my default shell script for console/some parts of git different between repos/RStudio projects?\nNo answers yet, but for right now I’m still able to maintain functionality while working locally because the terminal is functioning appropriately and I have a workaround to run bash code chunks included in Rmd files (see Oct.12 post)."

    "text": "I’ve continued trying to troubleshoot my issues with running bash code chunks in .Rmd files. Running Sys.which(“bash”) in the RStudio console the path “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe”, which I think is bash installed as a part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful."

I made a new github repo using the lab’s project template and tried running through one of the blast tutorials included in the project template, but immediately had problems with running the bash code chunks. I’ve done command-line data analysis work before, but never through an Rmarkdown file or in RStudio. When I tried to run any of the bash code chunks nothing would happen, not even an error output. First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin?

Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\nA: Differs among taxa. We have secondary evidence that it is in marine inverts. For taxa where there’s more evidence, modification has to happen during early developmental stages of gonads (presumably to alter the gamete cells). A lot of it is unknown though (similar for other forms of modification e.g. histone modification)\n\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 (Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation…)\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 studied polyploidy in oysters because of its common use in oyster aquaculture – does polyploidy have any potential conservation applications, particularly in eukaryotes, for whom ployploidy is often better tolerated? One scenario I can think of is intentional hybridization of two species to selectively breed a more resilient population – since polyploidy is more common in hybrids, may be important to understand its impacts. I also know polyploidy sometimes happens in corals (especially Caribbean corals), which can reproduce asexually fairly easily. (Need to read related paper Stephens et al. 2023 – w/ Putnam and Bhattacharya!)\n\nA: Since polyploidy reduces breeding potential so could be useful in conservation. But don;t have any information on relationship between polyploidy and methylation or the mechanisms of how polyploidy affects methylation\n\nConfused about a couple aspects of the experimental setup:\n\nStated that lab obtained 500 oysters for the experiment, but then states that the starting sample size of each of the six treatments (2 controls, 2 single stressor, 2 multiple stressors) was 112, which adds to way over 500 oysters\n\nA:\n\nFor the multiple stressors treatment, why was aerial exposure not repeated multiple times (since low tide happens on a regular daily schedule, not just once during a given warming event)?\n\nA: Don’t want to go overboard and kill all the oysters, so start out trying with less stressful stress conditions. Want to understand more than just the death outcome.\n\n\nIn Results, why is survival probability not the direct inverse of mortality?\n\nA: doesn’t know, maybe check supplemental materials or ask in Slack\n\nI think I noticed some typos… do you want to know about them or just leave it be?\n\nPutnam et al. 2023 (Dynamic DNA methylation contributes to carryover effects…)\n\nIn the results section I saw that shell area was used as a proxy for shell size – is it assumed that shell thickness remains fairly constant?

(I would assume so, but it would be interesting if acidic conditions messed with that relationship)\n\nA: Not assumed, but it wasn’t measured. Emma Tidman paper looks at effect of acidification on various measures of shell strength/size.\nA: Emma also looked at body mass/tissue impacts of acidification (but yes, there is generally a correlation between shell size and body mass)\n\nIn Fig.3 I’m a little confused about the y-axes of 3c and 3d – what is the baseline (the “1”) for these relative size values?

How often are GO annotations originally identified/set in one taxa validated for application in other taxa? How would that work? Is it even necessary?\nSo Zhu et al. 2022 found symbiont-associated miRNAs in coral transcriptome, but also mentioned in intro that (in other studies) foreign miRNA presence was correlated with intake (e.g. when human ate certain plant associated miRNAs present in human serum, but would disappear if they stopped eating that plant). Does that mean that presence/function of symbiont miRNAs in corals change when the coral is bleached (aka, the symbionts are gone)? If some symbiont miRNAs may be affecting coral immune response, could this play into coral immunocompromisation during bleaching?\nHas there been any similar work with other taxa of Symbiodiniaceae?\n\nTrigg et al. 2021\nAlso, not from either of the papers, but I was kind of confused about Sam’s discussion of trying different trimming sizes to ID miRNAs. I’ve only taken a basic molgen class though, which didn’t go very in-depth in to how RNAs (especially ncRNAs) work, so this may be a basic knowledge gap. In contrast to DNA, where all of the different introns/exons, etc. are contained in one long strand of DNA, I thought transcribed RNAs were separate molecules. If that’s the case my understanding on how we sequence miRNAs is that we isolate all the RNAs of a very small size (20-30bp) and then sequence them – why, then, would trimming (beyond removing the adapters that facilitate enrichment) be necessary? And how do you decide to do trimming?

I backed up all my work to Gannet, then undid all my local commits, and recommitted/pushed only the .gitignore file. Once it was pushed, I reran my code to generate all the outputs again, and was able to successfully commit and push.

    "text": "Read some papers on ncRNAs, questions for next Science Hour/meeting with Steven below:\nZhu et al. 2022: I thought this paper was sooooo cool! The possibility of cross-kingdom miRNA effects is crazy\n\nWhat is KEEG? (referenced similarly to GO) Just a different database?\n\nYep\n\n“Rho-related” terms? (In GO context)\n\nrelated to Rho protein family\n\nNo idea what Fig. 1 is showing\nI’ve noticed that GO annotations I’ve seen for corals never map to known coral functions – they’re always to similar things in other more-studied taxa (e.g. insects, nematodes). How often are GO annotations originally identified/set in one taxa validated for application in other taxa? How would that work? Is it even necessary?\nSo Zhu et al. 2022 found symbiont-associated miRNAs in coral transcriptome, but also mentioned in intro that (in other studies) foreign miRNA presence was correlated with intake (e.g. when human ate certain plant associated miRNAs present in human serum, but would disappear if they stopped eating that plant). Does that mean that presence/function of symbiont miRNAs in corals change when the coral is bleached (aka, the symbionts are gone)? If some symbiont miRNAs may be affecting coral immune response, could this play into coral immunocompromisation during bleaching?\nHas there been any similar work with other taxa of Symbiodiniaceae?\n\nTrigg et al. 2021\nAlso, not from either of the papers, but I was kind of confused about Sam’s discussion of trying different trimming sizes to ID miRNAs. I’ve only taken a basic molgen class though, which didn’t go very in-depth in to how RNAs (especially ncRNAs) work, so this may be a basic knowledge gap. In contrast to DNA, where all of the different introns/exons, etc. are contained in one long strand of DNA, I thought transcribed RNAs were separate molecules. If that’s the case my understanding on how we sequence miRNAs is that we isolate all the RNAs of a very small size (20-30bp) and then sequence them – why, then, would trimming (beyond removing the adapters that facilitate enrichment) be necessary? And how do you decide to do trimming? Do all miRNAs have some identical feature that indicates the beginning/end of them (like start/stop codons in DNA)?"

For each project, have “about” page and posts for all the work I’m doing in that project (instead of having everything in just my daily logs). Still want to do something about all of the lit review notes/questions I currently have cluttering up my daily logs, but haven’t 100% decided how I want to do that yet…\nCompiled spreadsheets detailing the samples we plan on sending out for RNAseq and methylation"

I’m in the process of characterizting patterns of sncRNA + mRNA coexpression. Will also incorporate DNA methylation mapping and sncRNA/methylation interaction analysis.\n\nwere methylation samples sent out? for deep dive\ncould also include coral hDNA methylation in this if I receive the SIFP\nlogical expansion into PhD thesis is looking at time series data\n\nChapter 2: environmental memory in oysters\n\nwe have data for oysters under OA exposure. Described in parents, but not yet touched children. In parents have gene expression and methylation (plus lncRNA from the RNAseq data)\nso I could look into heritability of methylation in oysters\nmethylation data from the offspring already exists!! (i.e., the samples have already been sequenced)\nside note: lab has already looked into barcoding bisulfite-converted DNA, but had limited success because their gene of interest was very long and bisulfite treatment degrades high-molecular-weight DNA. It would be interesting to develop some kind of screening protocol to screen for methylation patterns associate with resilience. (e.g., for broodstock screening)\n\n\n\nTo-Do:\nE5:\n\nFor each miRNA, calculate correlation coefficent with each gene\nLook into miRNA binding again (get software from Jill?)\ninteractions with lncRNA (get data from Zach). Could also do binding here, since lncRNAs may be sponges, precursors, etc.\ncross-species stuff could be interesting – gene orthologs? but can be back burner for now\ncorrelation between methylation in an miRNA-coding region and expression of that miRNA.\n\nGeneral:\n\ncan bring Hollie in now for committee\nschedule meeting with steven, weekly thursdays at 11"

It was definitely a bit less productive that February – I was out for a bit, and Spring Break-related lab absences meant some work was slowed down. Regardless, I got some through some important stuff for the cod and oyster projects. I wrote a proposal for the oyster project (for class), which was really helpful for me to get my current understanding of the project on paper. The project will definitely be changing a bit from what I wrote, but I really appreciated the first step. I’ve taken the cod RNAseq data through all the basic DGE analysis using DESeq2. Now I need to tackle the GO analysis and look into using WGCNA to examine coexpression. I have probably half of a preliminary methods section of the cod manuscript done. I haven’t made a planning doc for the oyster experiment, largely because I’ve still been feeling very unclear on how exactly the project implementation is going to work. Hopefully I’ll be able to resolve that this month. Finally, I was able to meet with Laura about the cod project! She had some great suggestions for selecting methylation samples and for doing a more advanced analysis of the RNAseq data!"

I also wrote an sRNA workflow summary for the E5 manuscript, which was an interesting process. I don’t have much manuscript writing experience, so it’s always a fun surprise to realize just how time consuming it can be.\nWe’re expecting to get the code RNAseq data back in mid-February, so I want to set up a pipeline for that data before then.

Now just monitoring the reminder for mortality because they’re taking forever to die, despite not being fed for a full month at this point. See the project page for more\n\n\nE5 coral\nThe deep dive manuscript is in final stages (hopefully), and as far as I know I’ve fulfilled my contributions to the miRNA methods, results, and discussion sections.\nI’ve also started looking at gene expression and coexpression, details on that are in the expression github\n\n\nNSF GRFP\nI’ve been to a couple of info sessions/writing workshops for the NSF GRFP and have created my planning docs, updated CV, identified likely references, and started outlining my personal statement and research statement.\n\n\nDegree progress\nMy biggest goal this summer for degree progress was to nail down my committee and, due to sporadic personal and faculty availability, I unfortunately don’t have that yet. I thought I had my second SAFS faculty member, but they had to pull out due to personal reasons/needing to reduce commitments for this coming quarters. I’m contacting some other faculty though and hopefully I’ll have a replacement before the start of the quarter in ~3 weeks."

No correlation w solar radiation of rainfall suggests temp should be driving differential gene expression by timepoint. DGE analysis showed TP2 and TP4 as having most DEGs, but TP2 and TP3 have the two temperature extremes (highest and lowest) and are the only TPs significantly correlated with modules of gene expression. Maybe this is because both hot and cold extremes are handled by the same pathways, so TP2 and 3 have very similar “dealing with temp stress” expression profiles that contrast with TP1 and 4 “we’re at a comfortable temp” expression profiles?\nAlso notable, while TP2 and TP3 are significantly correlated with some of the same modules, they have opposite expression profile (upregulation vs. downregulation! Does this suggest that, while both warm and cool temperature stress may be associated with similar pathways, the way those pathways are modulated in differs when in response to different types of temp stress (e.g. gene is upregulated in response to heat stress and downregulated in response to cold stress)?\n\nEdit 3/18/2025 – realized after plotting out eigengenes of each module that this ^^ is a misinterpretation of the heatmap – shared modules between TP2 and TP3 actually have matching expression profiles.

    "text": "I’m currently trying to quantify RNA abundances using RNAseq data from the three E5 deep dive species, and I’m running into some issues for P. evermanni.\nLinks:\n\ncode (.Rmd)\nknitted file (.md)\ngithub issue\n\nThere’s no published transcriptome fasta for P. evermanni, so instead I’m using a published CDS gff file and associated scaffold genome fasta to assemble a de novo reference transcriptome fasta.\nI first used bedtools getfasta to extract fasta sequences for everything listed in the original CDS gff file, but ended up with duplicate sequences, which interferes with kallisto indexing. While trying (and failing) to remove duplicates with the fastx_toolkit fastx_collapser, Steven pointed out that the gff file (image below) I’m using contains sequences labeled as both CDS and mRNA sequences, and suggested I use only those labeled as mRNA.\n\nI selected only sequecnes labelled as “mRNA” in the gff, extracted those sequences fastas from the scaffold reference, and was able to successfully build a kallisto index, however I was given a warning that kallisto index had identified 10,722,052 non-ACGUT characters in the 40,389 input sequences (or ~265 non-ACGUT characters per sequence!). Quickly looking through some of the extracted sequence fastas, I found some of them contain long internal stretches of N characters.\n\nSam was able to inform me that this is due to the reference fasta I’m using to extract mRNA fastas. The reference is a scaffold, which characteristically contains arbitrary stretches of Ns connecting known sequences to others in the same region. Steven then also noticed that the gff file seems to be improperly labeled, with mRNA sequences that actually contain several CDS regions and introns, which could interfere with pseudoalignment. Instead, of using the labelled mRNAs, I may need to extract all the sequences labelled as CDS from the gff, obtain sequences fastas, group and concatenate by “Parent” (source mRNA) to exclude all of the introns, and then use those concatenated CDS fasta sequences as a reference for kallisto.\nSome pseudo code for doing this:\nstart with original.gff, which contains CDS, mRNA, UTR, etc. sequences\ngrep -w \"CDS\" original.gff &gt; filtered.gff\nnow I have a filtered gff that only contains info for CDS sequences in a format that looks like:\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000002\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000002\n…\nwhere each Parent ID (“Parent=Peve_00000001”) groups together CDS sequences that originate from the same mRNA. To get full concatenated fasta sequences for each mRNA I’ll do:\nfor i in #LinesInFiltered.gff:\n\n  get parentID of filtered.gff line i\n\n  if parentID not already in final.fasta:\n\n    extract all lines in filtered.gff with parentID\n    bedtools to get each lines' fasta sequence\n    concatenate all of these fastas\n    assign appropriate ID that includes parentID to concatenated fasta\n    add this parentID.fasta to final.fasta\nthis final.fasta should contain the same number of sequence fastas as unique parentIDs in filtered.gff"

    "text": "In the process of running kallisto on the three E5 deep dive species, we realized that there’s no transcriptome FASTA available for P. evermanni. That means we need to generate one!\nRendered code\nRelated posts:\nRNAseq abundance quantification (A.Pulchra, P.evermanni, P.meandrina)\nP.evermanni RNAseq kallisto debugging\nTesting bedtools: gff vs bed input file\n\nStarter files\nThe closest file to a P. evermanni transcriptome that we have is a P.evermanni coding sequence (CDS) gff file, and a corresponding genome scaffolds FASTA.\nhead of gff:\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove mRNA 3107 4488 543 - .

Parent=Peve_00000001\nA gff file lists information that can be used to identify and retrieve specific sequences. The first column lists the region or scaffold of a reference genome in which the sequence can be found; the third identifies which genomic feature (e.g., mRNA, CDS, UTR) the sequence is; and the fourth and fifth are genomic coordinates for the beginning and end of the sequence. Since we have both the coding sequences gff and a reference fasta, we should be able to extract FASTA sequences for all of the relevant sequences in the gff!\n\n\nExtract CDS sequences\nFirst, it looks like the gff has features labelled a little weirdly. Normally we’d want all of the mRNA sequences, but it looks like this file lists mRNA sequences that include introns. Instead, we want all of the CDS sequences associated with each mRNA (association is denoted in the final column with a parent mRNA ID, e.g. “Parent=Peve_00000001”). That means the first step is to extract all of the CDS sequences from our gff file.\n\n# Extract only the CDS sequence lines from the gff\ngrep -w 'CDS' ${transcriptome_gff} &gt; ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\n\nhead -n 5 ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\n\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove   CDS 3107    3444    .   -   .

Parent=Peve_00000002\n\n\nConvert gff to bed\nThen we convert this filtered CDS gff file to a bed file, which has slightly different formatting. We’re doing this because we’ll be using a tool called bedtools getfasta, which can take both gff and bed files, but which I trust more to appropriately parse bed files (though, see post on whether it can handle gff files correctly as well).\n\n# Ensure bedops can find its dependencies when running\nexport PATH=/home/shared/bedops_linux_x86_64-v2.4.41/bin:$PATH\n\n${bedops}/gff2bed \\\n--do-not-sort \\\n&lt; ${transcriptome_gff_filtered} \\\n&gt; ${transcriptome_bed}\n\nhead -n 3 ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\necho \"\"\nhead -n 3 ${transcriptome_bed}\n\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove   CDS 3107    3444    .   -   .

Each sequence with the same parent ID should be used to a) retrieve a FASTA for that sequence, and b) concatenate all of the FASTAs with the same parent ID into a single, labelled gene FASTA.

    "text": "We performed sRNA discovery for A. pulchra, P. evermanni, and P. tuahiniensis (formerly identified as P. meandrina) as part of the E5 deep-dive initiative. Notably, we used the A. millipora genome as an alignment reference during A. pulchra sRNA discovery because no A. pulchra genome was available at the time. However, collaborators are have now assembled an A. pulchra genome, so we can rerun sRNA discovery with a better reference for use in the deep-dive-expression project. Additionally, the sRNA discovery tool we decided to use, ShortStack Axtell (2013), has a new update (v.4.1.0) with functionality for visualizing miRNA hairpin structures and generating genome-browser-ready quantitative coverage tracks of aligned small RNAs. These new features could prove useful, so I’m just rerunning ShortStack for all three species, using the pulchra genome for A. pulchra discovery and ShortStack 4.1.0 for all three.\nOriginal deep-dive sRNA discovery, using ShortStack 4.0.3 (for reference):\nA. pulchra (using A. millipora genome)\nP. evermanni\nP. tuahiniensis (identified here as P. meandrina, using P. meandrina genome)\ndeep-dive-expression reruns with ShortStack 4.1.0:\nA. pulchra (using A. pulchra genome)\nP. evermanni\nP. tuahiniensis (using P. meandrina genome)"

    "text": "One way miRNAs and DNA methylation can interact to influence expression is through miRNAs influencing the transcription/translation of protein machinery involved in DNA methylation. In humans, this has been identified as a potential mechanism of carcinogenisis! (Reviewed in Karimzadeh et al. (2021))\n\n\n“DNA methylation machinery is composed of several enzymes to accurately regulate the gene expression together. The main enzyme-encoding genes comprise a small family of DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase, which are involved in established (DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B)) and maintenance (DNMT1) of methylation patterns. The other genes are methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBPs; methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD)1–4, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), UHRF1/2, ZBTB33, ZBTB4, and ZBTB38) that assist in expression repression and 10–11 translocation (TET) enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3); seemingly, are implicated in DNA demethylation10,11. Some experiments demonstrated that, based on the importance of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes alterations in the development of each type of cancer, DNA methylation regulator genes may enhance or suppress cancer development in each specific type of cancer12,13,14,15,16.” Karimzadeh et al. (2021)\nSo we’re looking for miRNAs that target genes encoding: - DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) - methyl-CpG-binding proteins - 10–11 translocation (TET) enzymes\nFirst let’s see what a quick search of our annotated A.pulchra genome turns up.

    "text": "“DNA methylation machinery is composed of several enzymes to accurately regulate the gene expression together. The main enzyme-encoding genes comprise a small family of DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase, which are involved in established (DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B)) and maintenance (DNMT1) of methylation patterns. The other genes are methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBPs; methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD)1–4, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), UHRF1/2, ZBTB33, ZBTB4, and ZBTB38) that assist in expression repression and 10–11 translocation (TET) enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3); seemingly, are implicated in DNA demethylation10,11.

In it, I:\nFrankly, this is sooooo much data and I didn’t figure out a great way to summarize all of the results in a visual or digestible way. Here a few summary figures:\nWhich traits have the most significantly correlated modules/genes?\nFor traits of interest, what biological processes are overrepresented, and what overlap is there among traits of interest?\nThe true value of these analyses will require identifying a trait/module/miRNA of interest and the looking at what functions are enriched for it. I’ve been playing around with some interaction network visualizations, similarly to what I did with the miRanda/Pcor results, but this includes many more genes and is thus much more computationally intensive and would make the visualization less helpful\nCode copied below in case of file path changes:\nAfter running WGCNA to evaluate modules of mRNA and miRNA with correlated expression, we need to functionally annotate genes to evaluate module function(s)."

With this in mind I’ve been looking for a text-to-speech tool that would enable me to listen to academic papers, textbooks, etc.! I’m hoping this could really improve my lit review workflow, especially since many of the papers I’m reading right now are reviews with fewer tables/figures that sometimes complicate applying TTS to academic material.

    "text": "Audemic\nPrice: $10.99/mo OR $118/yr\nFree Trial: 5 papers\nFeatures:\n\nCan import pdfs directly from Zotero (though kind of buggy)\nHas navigable sectioning of PDFs, and you can reorder the sections (e.g. skipping Methods) as you like\nGenerates a high-level summary of the document\nSkips in-text citations\nCan annotate/highlight in-text\nCan change the background color, font, and reading speed\nMulti-device\n\nI have mixed feelings about Audemic. I liked a lot of things about the narration itself. Some of the voice options were very human-like and easy to listen to, and it did a pretty good (though not perfect) job of pronouncing uncommon jargon. On the other hand, I disliked several aspects of how it displays the content you’ve uploaded while it’s narrating it. Upon uploading a pdf, all of the text is extracted and displayed in a sectioned viewing pane that is completely removed from the original pdf (see below). That means that, in order to refer to figures or find “where” what you’re listening to is in the original document , you have to navigate to a completely separate pane to view the original pdf. Audemic also doesn’t track in-text where the reader is at that time, so it’s very difficult to find where you are in the text. Finally, there are a couple annoying things, like buggy Zotero uploading and being unable to switch “voice” without re-uploading the document.\nOverall, given the many features I find annoying and the still-high price tag, I’m not sure Audemic is worth the money, but it is the most human-like option I’ve found so far."

    "text": "Voice Dream\nPrice: $80/yr\nFree Trial: 3 days (but can’t try without providing payment info😑)\nFeatures:\n\nOffline access and multi-device, and available as an iOS app\nSkips in-text citations\nCan annotate/highlight in-text\nCan change the background color, font, and reading speed\nMany options for customizing text navigation\n\nHonestly I came into Voice Dream kind of biased against it, because I think its recent price hike, from a one-time fee of $30 (April 2023) to $80/yr, and its requirement of payment info to access the free trial are kind of scummy practices. Objectively though, it does seem like a decent option.\nThe real strengths of Voice Dream seem to lie in its customizable text navigation features. For example, you can choose your forward and backward “skip” buttons to skip by different time intervals, by paragraph, by heading, etc. You can set a timer for how long the narration will read, and can change a variety of visual settings (font, spacing, background color, etc.). When reading you can choose to view the text in either a plain text viewing pane or in the original document and both options support an in-text speech cursor to show where the narration is.\nHowever, several of the boasted features fell flat to me. While there are a ton of voices to choose from, all of the ones I tried are much more synth-sounding than Audemic, in both tone and inflection. Pronunciation of jargon is also not as good as Audemic, though there does seem to be a feature for correcting pronunciation of individual words. As in Audemic, your voice selection is document-specific, so you have to re-select the voice you want every time. While the website claims Voice Dream skips citations and superfluous text, when I uploaded a pdf and tried listening it didn’t skip either of these. It also didn’t identify sections for my uploaded pdf (e.g. Abstract, Intro, etc.), so I couldn’t use the section navigation option. On top of these disappointing features, some features are missing entirely. Voice Dream has no web app, so you can’t listen from a PC or Android, and there’s no option to import directly from Zotero or PaperPile, meaning manual upload is required.\nUltimately I know the quality of the voice is going to be much more important for my retention than text navigation features, so I don’t think Voice Dream is a good option for me. The voices are just too robotic, especially in comparison with Audemic."

It’s very expensive, and the price was increased in the last month from an already high $120/yr to a staggering $140/yr. After trying it out, though, I think this may be my favorite option!\nSpeechify has all of the standard text navigation/viewing options (in-text tracker, can view original document or transcribed reading pane with viewing features, adjustable reading speed, skip citations+, etc.), but there are two features that really stand out to me. The first is that a lot of the voices are very lifelike and easy for me to listen to, which is really important to me. The second is their ambient sound option, which allows you to play background sound (e.g. music on Spotify, white noise) at an automatically lowered volume while the app narrates text on top. This is super cool for me! I’ve been looking for something like this for a really long time, because when I work out I want to play music with a suitable beat, but I also want to listen to audiobooks or something because I get bored quickly – that’s exactly what this feature does! The last cool feature that also deserves a mention is Speechify’s AI integration. You can generate AI summaries of any document, and you can ask questions to chatGPT in the speechify app and then listen to the responses.\nMost of my annoyances with Speechify are pretty minor. Like most of the other options, Speechify doesn’t have a way to upload documents directly from Zotero (or any other reference manager), which makes the process more tedious. There’s also no feature to separate text into navigable sections (e.g. Intro, Methods), and you can’t annotate in-app, so you’d need to switch to a different tool to make notes, highlight, etc."

    "section": "",
    "text": "While writing some script to generate a transcriptome fasta using a CDS gff and scaffold genome, I ran into the question of how exactly the bedtools getfasta tool handles gff and bed file inputs. While both gff and bed files list basically the same types of sequence information, they list the genomic coordinates of the sequences slightly differently. gff files use a 1-based system, while bed files use a 0-based system (for details on how those differ, see this website post that I found helpful!). Bedtools states in the documentation for it’s getfasta function that gff files are accepted as input, but it isn’t made clear whether bedtools will treat the genomic coordinates in a gff file as 1-based, or as the o-based system used in bedtool’s more standard file format, bed.\nTo test whether bedtools can appropriately identify and parse both gff and bed files, I wrote some quick test files to run through bedtools getfasta.\nWrite the test files:\n\n\necho -e \"&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\" &gt; test_input.fasta\necho -e \"AAAGGGTTTCCCAAAGGGTTTCCC\" &gt;&gt; test_input.fasta\n\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t1\\t5\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt; test_input.gff\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t11\\t15\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt;&gt; test_input.gff\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t20\\t20\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000002\" &gt;&gt; test_input.gff\n\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t0\\t5\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt; test_input.bed\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t10\\t15\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt;&gt; test_input.bed\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t19\\t20\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000002\" &gt;&gt; test_input.bed\n\nexport PATH=/home/shared/bedops_linux_x86_64-v2.4.41/bin:$PATH\n\n${bedops}/gff2bed --do-not-sort &lt; test_input.gff &gt; test_input_gfftobed.bed\n\nRun through bedtools getfasta:\n\nsource .bashvars\ncd ~/deep-dive/E-Peve/data\n\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input.gff -fo test_gff_to_fasta.fasta\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input.bed -fo test_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input_gfftobed.bed -fo test_gff_to_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n\nhead test_gff_to_fasta.fasta\necho \"\"\nhead test_bed_to_fasta.fasta\necho \"\"\nhead test_gff_to_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n\nOutput:\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T  \n\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T  \n\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T\nAll three files resulted in identical FASTA outputs !

    "text": "After looking through one of Sarah’s posts I noticed she has some super cool features included in her Quarto digital lab notebook, so I’m doing a deep dive into the Quarto documentation!\n\nEmbedding source code\nYou can allow readers of a webpage to view all of the code used to create that HTML by including in the YAML:\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-tools:\n      source: true\nIn the rendered HTML you’ll see an “&lt;/&gt; Code” icon next to the post title, and clicking this icon will show the page’s source code!\n(Since all of the code for this post should now be viewable directly from the HTML, I won’t be inserting code chunks for any other sections to show what code to use for each feature. )\n\n\nBootstrap icons\nThere are soooooo many cute icons to choose from (not really Quarto-specific, but you can use them in Quarto docs)\n\n\nTabsets\nYou can use tabsets to display sets of related information, separated by some features (e.g., programming language, treatment, species)\n\nPythonR\n\n\ndef even_or_odd(number):\n    if number % 2 == 0:\n        result = \"even\"\n    else:\n        result = \"odd\"\n    return result\n\n\neven_or_odd &lt;- function(number) {\n  if (number %% 2 == 0) {\n    result &lt;- \"even\"\n  } else {\n    result &lt;- \"odd\"\n  }\n  return(result)\n}\n\n\n\nYou can also group tabsets by the tab names, so that when you switch tabs in one tabset, the other grouped tabsets will also switch to the same tab!\n\nPythonRBash\n\n\nAn ok programming language\n\n\nThe far superior programming language\n\n\nBane of my existence\n\n\n\n\nPythonRBash\n\n\nA kind of snake\n\n\nThe sound a pirate makes\n\n\nBane of my existence\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-text annotation\nYou can enable in-text annotations in a post! Try highlighting a word – the options “Annotate” and “Highlight” should pop up (though you’ll need an account with hypothesis.is to use this feature – there are also options for instead using Utterances or Giscus for in-text annotation))\n\n\nFigures\nThere are a bunch of different ways to attach links and captions to text/images very easily, and to quickly generate sets of figures.\n\n\n\nDead man walking\n\n\n\n\nVideos\nYou can directly embed videos!\n\n\n\nDiagrams\nThere are two types of diagrams that are supported by Quarto, Mermaid and Graphviz, and they both have webtools you can use to more easily design a diagram and get the code needed to generate it\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n  C --&gt; E[Result two]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbedding from other posts/documents\nThere are awhole bunch of ways to embed figures/code outputs/etc. from other documents in your notebook into a new post (see more at above link).\n\n\nCallouts\nYou can insert 5 diffferent types of callout blocks in your text to draw attention to certain information! (I think this is super cool!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nwarning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nimportant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip with Title\n\n\n\ntip\n(This is an example of a callout with a title)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Collapse\n\n\n\n\n\nand caution\nThis is an example of a ‘folded’ caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use collapse=\"true\" to collapse it by default or collapse=\"false\" to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n\n\n\nYou can also adjust the appearance of callouts in your doc\n\n\nCode annotation\nYou can insert footnote-like in-code anotations. This seems potentially redundant if you have good commenting in your code but it could still help make code explanations more digestible. You can also adjust how the annotation will appear using the code-annotations: command in the document YAML.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n1penguins |&gt;\n2  mutate(\n    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm,\n    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm\n  )\n\n1\n\nTake penguins, and then,\n\n2\n\nadd new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor tools\nThere are a whooooolllllleeee bunch of different options for specifying different author/article information that’s normally included in scientific publications (authors, affiliations, corresponding, copyright, orcid ID, abstract, keywords, etc.).

    "section": "",
    "text": "We (Eric, Grace L., Ariana, and I) spent the day at the Point Whitney research station, performing a reciprocal heat stress treatment and sampling on 4 Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) life stages (spat, seed, juvenile, adult) for Eric’s thesis work. See previous post for materials and Ariana’s post for project details.\nOrganism: Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)\nLifestages: Seed, Spat, Juvenile, Adult\nFor each of the four life stages, Eric had already performed an original conditioning treatment. We an additiol reciprocal exposure to acute stress. For example, half of the spat “control” group was exposed to the 32*C “high” stress, half of the “control” group was left in ambient temperature, half of the “treated” spat group was exposed to the 32*C “high” stress, and half of the “treated” spat group was left in ambient.\nConditioning treatment groups: Control, Treated\nAcute stress treatment groups: Ambient, High (32*C)\nPossible treatment group combinations: Control/Ambient, Control/High, Treated/Ambient, Treated/High\nFor each age class, each set of treatment conditions was sampled. Sampling was performed slightly differently for each age, due to size restrictions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge class\nSampling approach (for each of the 4 treatment combinations)\n\n\n\n\nSpat\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Whole animals were preserved, since the spat are too small to easily extract tissue from the shell.\n\n\nSeed\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Seed are larger than spat, so we were able to crack open the shell of each animal and preserve the whole animal tissue.\n\n\nJuvenile\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Juveniles are large enough to open the shell and differentiate between tissue types, but too small to split gill tissue into multiple samples, so the entire gill tissue of each animal was sampled.\n\n\nAdult\nOverview: 24 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=8, DNA n=8, frozen n=8) from 8 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 8 animals total. From each animal, gill tissue was extracted and separated into three portions, which were preserved for RNA, DNA, and flash frozen. This means we have “sets” of samples for the adults (e.g. a sample preserved for RNA work is associated with a sample preserved for DNA and a sample that was flash frozen, since all three are from the same animal), with a total of 24 samples for each treatment combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl/Ambient\nControl/High\nTreated/Ambient\nTreated/High\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nSpat\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nSeed\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nJuvenile\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nAdult\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 32\nDNA: 32\nfrozen: 32\n96 total\n\n\nTotal\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 104\nDNA: 104\nfrozen: 92\n300 total samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe oysters (each age class and treatment group in individual tubes or bags)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA juvenile oyster during sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOysters post-sampling"

Graduate study focused on community, public, or global health, or other population-based research including medical intervention trials is also not eligible.\nc) Ineligible proposed research\n(i) Research for which the goals are directly human disease- or health-related, including the etiology, diagnosis, and/or treatment of disease or disorder is not eligible for support. Research activities using animal models of disease, for developing or testing of drugs or other procedures for treatment of disease or disorder are not eligible.\n(ii) Research focused on basic questions in plant pathology are eligible, however, applied studies focused on maximizing production in agricultural plants or impacts on food safety, are not eligible.\n(iii) Research with implications that inform policy is eligible. Research with the expressed intent to influence, advocate for, or effect specific policy outcomes is not eligible.\nd) Limited exceptions to ineligible proposed research\n(i) Certain areas of bioengineering research directed at medical use are eligible. These include research projects in bioengineering to aid persons with disabilities, or to diagnose or treat human disease or disorder, provided they apply engineering principles to problems in medicine while primarily advancing engineering knowledge. Applicants planning to study and conduct research in these areas of bioengineering should select biomedical engineering as the field of study.\n(ii) Certain areas of materials research directed at development of materials for use in biological or biomedical systems are eligible, provided they are focused on furthering fundamental materials research.\n(iii) Certain areas of research with etiology-, diagnosis-, or treatment-related goals that advance fundamental knowledge in engineering, mathematical, physical, computer or information sciences, are eligible for support.\nAquaculture and other forms of animal farming is not specifically mentioned, but the emphasis seems to be that research should be intended to advance fundamental knowledge. Since aquaculture is inherently applied, it’s probably best to steer clear in the proposal."

    "text": "Addressing some questions/notes raised during preliminary project planning\n\nGametogenisis/spawning conditions\nWe’d need to make sure they don’t spawn, so need to do some digging into what conditions might induce spawning. Would be important during priming stage.\nIn hatchery settings:\n\n“In the Pacific Northwest, the Pacific oyster may be induced to spawn and viable gametes may be obtained at any time during the year. Year-round spawning is possible because the Pacific oyster normally does not completely spawn out in all Pacific Northwest estuarine areas, generally too cool to induce complete spawning.”\nConditioning: Oyster with sufficient glycogen stores held at 18-20C for 4 weeks to develop mature gametes. These conditioned oysters will be prime for induced spawning for the next 2-4 weeks.\nInitiating spawning: Raise water to 25C, then to 30C over 30min period. Then fluctuate between 25C and 30C. Addition of gametes to the water can also induce spawning, presumably because of some hormone signaling.\n(Breese and Malouf 1975)\n\nIn natural/outplant conditions:\n\nIn France’s Thau Lagoon, which is characterized by no tidal amplitude (oysters remain submerged), high summer temps and salinities (&gt;26C and 36 PSU), low phytoplankton concentration, and high oyster growth rates.\n“gametogenesis intensity (GSI, fecundity) was correlated to the abundance of diatoms”\n“spawning in C. gigas does not occur below a daily seawater temperature of 17-18°C”, but also noted that mass spawning in the warm Thau Lagoon occurred at a much higher temp of 22C, likely because of the water’s higher average temperature and/or the absence of a tide cycle that would expose the oysters to dessication or aerial temperature stress. So there’s some room for thermal acclimatization/adaptation in the spawning trigger!\nOther possible spawning triggers include phytoplankton concentration, lunar cycle, and presence of thunder storms.\n(Ubertini et al. 2017)\n\nExperimental testing:\n\nExperimental testing of environmental conditions impact on gametogenisis (gonadal development/broodstock conditioning)\nFastest gonadal development (oocyte maturation) at 22C (first mature oocytes in 19 days)\n\n(Chávez-Villalba et al. 2002)\n\nSummary: Generally speaking, gametogenisis is prompted by a minimum temperature of 17C - 18C in the presence of sufficient energy storage. Fastest maturation happens around 22C, with spawning triggered by warmer temperatures than used during conditioning (e.g., 25C to 30C). If we’re acclimatizing in the 25C range there will likely be resultant gametogenisis, but conditioning for ~2 weeks is sufficiently short to prevent full gonadal maturation (“ripening”) and subsequent spawning. Not entirely clear though what happens if you hold at 20C for 2 weeks and then drop back down in temp – would gametogenisis continue?\n\n\nHardening timeline\nShould look at all the hardening papers to try to assess best timeline (e.g. how long to harden, how long to wait between hardening and stress)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAge\nSource\nHardening regime\nOutcome\nPaper\n\n\n\n\nManila clam (R. philippinarum)\nadult\nwild caught\n28C or 30C for 2 hrs, recover for 12 hrs, stress test of 30C or 32C 1wk\n30C hardening improved survival at 30C stress\n(Zhang, Nie, and Yan 2023)\n\n\nOlympia oyster (O. lurida)\njuvenile\nhatchery\n15C or 21C 2wks, plus tide treatment (submerged & exposed for 6hr each, 2x/day).

Then hardened at 28C or 30C for 2 hours, then left to recover at 18C for 12 hours. Then subjected to extreme stress test (increase 2C/hr), either 30C or 32C for one week. Found that 30C hardening significantly improved survival time at 30C stress, but 28C did not (in comparison to non-hardened). Also, hardening made no difference at the 32C stress test. Maybe this means that it’s best to harden at temperature of stress test (i.e. harden at temperature expected to experience in MHW conditions)?\n(Shukla 2023):\nJuvenile O. lurida, juvenile C. sikamea, and juvenile C. gigas from hatchery. Acclimated at 15C, treatment groups hardened at 21C (0.5C/hr) for 2 weeks. In both control and temperature treatment, also included a tide treatment, in which oysters were intermittently submerged and exposed for 6hr each, twice a day. After hardening, recovered at immerged at 15C for 24hr. MHW treatments (reached at 0.5C/hr) were 15C, 18C, 1C, and 24C, no tidal component, for 72hr. Surviving O. lurida were outplanted in Sacramento for 9 months (March 2022 - Dec. 2022).\nVery little mortality (&lt;10%) in all species/treatments during hardening/MHW test, and no significant effect of temp or tidal hardening on MHW survival. In O. lurida and C. sikamea, temp hardening had a negative impact on growth (i.e. 15C control was largest). However, in C. gigas, temp hardening had no effect on growth and tidal hardening improved growth. In outplanting, all O. lurida with tidal hardening died, but those hardened at 21C (fully submerged) had much higher survival than control (15C submerged).\n(Moyen et al. 2020):\nAdult, wild-caught M. californianus hardened at 25C, 30C, or 35C for 2hr, then recovered at 14C for 1-28 days, then underwent stress test at 40C for 2hr. Following stress test, back in 14C and monitered for 4 weeks. 30C hardening conferred improved heat tolerance for 14 days, and the 35C hardening improved survival for 21 days after extreme stress, but effect gone by day 28.\nThis experimental design has a great component of waiting 4 weeks after extreme stress to evaluate mortality. I really like this idea, since stress could kill after the actual event is over. Also, test temperatures selected because 25C was lowest temp at which HSPs are upregulated in species, 35C is ~1C below species’ critical temperature of cardiac function, and 40C is avg lethal temp in species. Also has a cool graph of # days between heat stress bouts.\n“Heat hardening has typically been defined as a transient response that confers improved heat tolerance immediately after the initial heat-stress bout for up to 32 h [9,12,13,39,40], while longer-lasting improvements in heat tolerance are termed as heat acclimation.”\n(Scanes et al. 2023):\nAustralian adult, hatchery-reared S. glomerata acclimated for 1 week at 23C. Two emmersion heat treatments, 30C and 40C. First hardening 1.5hr, back to ambient 1 wk, then three more hardening treatments of 2 hrs each, separated by 1 wk each time (total of 4 hardening treatments over 4 weeks). Simulated MHW 1wk after final hardening, kept at emmersed 50C for 2hr. Monitered for 48 hr, then checked at day 8 and 16. Also note there’s an antibiotic group, since study investigates pathogen load.\n40C hardening improved survival and growth, but 30C did not. Also, control+antibiotic oysters had improved survival. Suggests hardening may be bolstering capacity to repel pathogenic bacteria as one mechanism of improving post-HW survival.\n(He et al. 2021):\nAdult, wild-caught P. maxima oysters acclimated at 24C for 1 day, then exposed to MHW conditions at 28C and 32C for 3 days, 3 days recovery, followed by another exposure and recovery. Note that 36C treatment also attempted but saw 100% mortality. Observed significant changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes, biomineralization-related enzymes, and energy-metabolizing enzymes. Note this isn’t actually a hardening experiment, it’s a repeat MHW exposure experiment. It’s energetics-focused though, so should probably read in more depth at some point.\n(Giomi et al. 2016):\nWild-caught tropical oyster I. nucleus, acclimated at 26C for 1month. Emmersed at 26C (control) and 40C for 4 hrs, then immersed again in 26C and 35C (reciprocal exposure setup, 4 treatment combos total). Temperature-induced mortality rate and 50% lethal temp then measured, plus respirometry and hsp70 mRNA expression. Thermal tolerance, lethal temperature threshold, and oxygen consumption rates significantly improved in heat-stressed group (40C-26c and 40C-35C), and hsp70 expression increased. Interestingly though, feeding rates following stress were much lower in the heat-stressed groups.\nSimilar resilience evaluation approach to what we’re thinking in own project (quantifying temperature induced mortality and 50% lethal temp as a biomarker)\n\nMHW definition is pretty distinct, would need to decide what type of scenario to simulate\nNeed to figure out sample sizes for whatever tests I want to do. Would be benefited by running some test assays before starting experiment. A bunch of these assays have been used with Pacific oysters already, so could find those and make a table or something. \nApparently heartbeat is potentially a better metric for metabolic rate than respiration, and is nondestructive\nShould also keep in mind that genetic composition can completely change the true sample size (e.g., if triploids and diploids are siblings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBreese, Wilbur P, and Robert E Malouf. 1975. “Hatchery Manual for the Pacific Oyster.” Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program Agricultural Experiment Station (443). https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/db78td066.\n\n\nChávez-Villalba, Jorge, Julien Pommier, Jimmy Andriamiseza, Stéphane Pouvreau, Jean Barret, Jean-Claude Cochard, and Marcel Le Pennec. 2002. “Broodstock Conditioning of the Oyster Crassostrea Gigas: Origin and Temperature Effect.” Aquaculture 214 (1): 115–30. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(01)00898-5.\n\n\nGiomi, Folco, Concetta Mandaglio, Monthon Ganmanee, Guo-Dong Han, Yun-Wei Dong, Gray A.

    "text": "Trial run of extreme stress test using the extra untreated, diploid “13” oysters currently stored in seawater cold room in FTR.\n\n\n\nPlan\nPlace oysters in 43C seawater for 1hr, then remove and return to ambient. Check daily for mortality for ~2wks.\n\n\nTrial protocol\n\nFilled a clean tripour container with 700 mL of seawater from the cold seawater tank in FTR. Placed in the incubator at 42C at roughly 13:00 7/11/2024.\nIsolated two groups of 10 oysters from bag “13” (untreated diploid), selecting similarly sized sets of oysters. Placed the two groups into small mesh bags, then placed back in the cold seawater tank (~10C) in FTR. Selected and grouped oysters at roughly 15:00 7/11/2024.\nNote: …at 17:30 the seawater still isn’t at 43C. Incubator is now empty so setting the incubator to 44C, covered the tripour with plastic wrap to prevent evaporation, and leaving it to finish preheating overnight. Will hopefully be able to finish this stress tomorrow.\nRandomly assigned one bag to treatment and one to control. Labelled each with a labelled 15mL tube placed inside bag and a colored zip tie attached to the bag (didn’t have any waterproof bag tags). Red is 43C group and blue is control. Measured length of each oyster in each group using a caliper, then placed back in respective labelled bags. Roughly 11:30 7/12/2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaced control oysters in tripour containing 700mL seawater from FTR tank, ambient temperature (13C). Left on table in cold room for 1 hr (11:47 - 12:47 7/12/2024), then placed oysters back into FTR tank.\n\n\nPlaced treatment oysters in tripour of warm seawater (~25C) for 10 seconds, then placed in tipour of 700mL seawater heated to 43C. Left in incubator set to 43.5C for 1 hr (11:51 - 12:53 7/12/2024). After 1 hr, removed and placed back into FTR tank.\n\nI dipped the treatment oysters into warmed water before treatment because I was worried about them bringing down the treatment temperature when added. Unfortunately, this attempt didn’t do enough to prevent the treatment water cooling, because at the end of the 1 hr treatment the water was only ~38C, despite being held in the heated incubator the whole time.\n\nCheck oysters in both groups for mortality once per day at roughly noon for the next 2 weeks. To check mortality, remove bag of oysters from tank, empty bag onto table. An empty shell or gaping with no response to stimulation (prodding with metal tool) indicates mortality.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBig takeaway is that I need to rethink the heating mechanism. It took a whole day for 700mL of water to be heated from 13C to 43C in the incubator, and the incubator is also unable to keep the water at correct temperature after adding oysters. Part of this problem could be solved by having two tripours heated all the way to 43C and using one to “preheat” the oysters before completing the full treatment in the second cup, but I still think we’d end up with the same problem of not staying at 43.\n\nThe rod heaters used at PW seem much faster and capable of maintaining a steady temp, but they also have to be used with a greater water volume. Maybe the stress test should be done in a bucket of heated seawater? Should only take a 2-3 hrs to heat bucket to 43 with one of those rods, the larger water volume means temp would be way less reduced by addition of oysters, and the rod heater would more quickly bring the water back up to 43 if needed.\nAs for this current stress test trial, I’m not really sure what to do about this. If the oysters were only in 35-38C water for the entire hour then it was more like the hardening treatmetnt and I’d guess won’t be very lethal. I think I’ll check mortality daily through the weekend, and if there’s no significant mortality in either group by Monday I’ll retry the stress test.\n\n\nMortality\nChecked bags daily at roughly noon for mortality. Mortality evaluated by prodding oysters and squeezing lightly at base of hinge. Empty shells or oysters that gaped and remained open during stimulation were considered dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTime\nControl (mm length of dead oyster(s))\nExtreme stress (mm length of dead oyster(s))\n\n\n\n\n7/13\n13:00\n-\n-\n\n\n7/14\n11:15\n-\n-\n\n\n7/15\n12:00\n30\n29, 30\n\n\n\nNotes: First mortalities on 7/15 (3 days after stress) in the smallest oysters, but see mortalities in both stress and control groups."

The oysters were packed in a cooler with ice, sandwiched between layers of wet paper/cardboard and foam, so that the oysters never came in direct contact with ice. They were packed like this for ~4 hours before I got them back to FTR and placed them in the right seawater tank in the FTR cold room. The tank contains seawater made from freshwater and Instant Sea, mixed to a salinity of ~27 psu, and held at 20C. These conditions were selected to match the ambient salinity and temperature the oysters experienced at Point Whitney for the last month. I also added roughly 15mL of Instant Algae once the oysters were placed in the tank, diluted before addition.\n\n\nOther PW tasks\nI also took probe measurements from the dock and upweller we’ve been using (see picture below), and then packed both the probe and a new HOBO temperature logger to bring back to FTR.

I changed the water in each cup regularly, maintaing a roughly 1:6 ratio of oyster: water volume. Water used was dechlorinated tap water mixed with Instant Ocean to ~25psu salinity. Notably, no algae or either food has been added during water changes – the oysters were last fed just before Survivorship Round 2 (August 9 2024). For the first few weeks I changed the water every 1-2 days. Once I felt sure that latent effect of the survivorship trial had presented themselves I began extending the time between water changes to ~1 week. I noticed little change in mortality following the increased time between water changes, so I’m assuming there is sufficient ambient air-water exchange to prevent asphyxiation between changes.\nGeneral observations (see details in pictures and paper lab notebook):"

Since flow cells are the most expensive component of nanopore sequencing by far, multiplexing could dramatically reduce the sequencing cost per sample.\nAccording to Rubi, Knowles, and Dantzer (2020), while recommended minimum read depth for methylation analysis is 10X, their hDNA samples showed little difference in # of CpG positions for a minimum read depth of 5X and 10X. So our goal should be a minimum of 10X depth, but lower could be acceptable?\nDeng et al. (2024) used a PromethION for WGS of the human genome and multiplexed 3 samples per cell, incorporating a cell wash to improve performance, and generated 154 Gb of output with a final mean read depth of 12X. This tracks with ONT’s specifications of 100-200 Gb output gDNA reads from a PromethION flow cell. NOTE though that the human genome is *much* larger than a coral genome. \nIf we assume an output of 150 Gb (150,000 Mb), how many samples could be multiplexed while maintaining minimum read depth?\n\nHuman genome: 3,000 Mb\n10X read depth: 30,000 Mb\nSequencing output: 150,000 Mb\nMultiplexing max = 5 samples/flow cell\nCoral genome: 500 Mb\n10X read depth: 5,000 Mb\nSequencing output: 150,000 Mb\nMultiplexing max = 30 samples/flow cell\n\nSay we want 3 time points (e.g., 100yo, 50yo, &lt;20yo). Probably need a minimum of n=5 for each, so minimum of N=15.\nI think we’d easily be able to run all 15 samples on a single flow cell! Since flow cells are only sold in packs of 4, we’ll also end up with extra to do more sequencing if desired/possible. \n\n\nChoosing library prep\n\nRapid (ligation-free) library prep kit seems best. Of the methylation-friendly options, it requires the least input DNA (still kind of high though? 100ng?). It also has barcode options to support multiplexing!\n\n\nCost estimate:\nAssuming minimum N=15 on a PromethION, incorporating multiplexing to reduce cost/sample.\n\n\n\nItem\n# rxns/unit\nPrice ($/unit)\n# units\nTotal cost\n\n\nRapid Barcoding Kit 96 V14\n96\n1100\n1\n1100\n\n\nPromethION Flow Cell Packs (R10.4.1)\n1 pack: 4 cells\n3980\n1\n3980\n\n\nFlow Cell Wash Kit\n6\n115\n1\n115\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5,195\n\n\n\nSo estimated cost of library prep and sequencing for N=15 samples on a PromethION sequencing platform is $5,195. Note that this could be reduced by a few hundred dollars by buying a 24-reaction library prep kit, but it’s dramatically more cost effective to buy the 96-reaction kit. That also gives us plenty of wiggle room for unsuccessful library prep or sequencing.\nNote that this doesn’t take DNA extraction and QC into account. I’ll need to talk to Andrea about this portion since the LAB has some community-available resources and the number of samples I’ll extract/QC will be strongly influenced by extraction success.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDeng, Wayne Xianding, Monika Sun, Pauline Ng, Premal Shah, Kate Im, and Akash Kumar. 2024. “P646: Development of an Affordable Rapid Human Genome Sequencing Assay Using Long Read PromethiON 2.” Genetics in Medicine Open 2: 101552. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gimo.2024.101552.\n\n\nRubi, Tricia L., L.
