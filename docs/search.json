See all details and original data collection in physical lab notebook, digital copy of mortality and meta data here.\nAs a reminder, I have diploid and triploid Pacific oysters that were hardened using 6 treatments of 35C for 4hours, over the course of 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of recovery they were brought back to FTR, acclimated, sampled, and used in a survivorship test of 42C Resazurin for 4hours. However, since I made the mistake of pooling all oysters in each treatment group, I compromised independence, making the results statistically meaningless. During this second attempt at a survivorship trial I’ll keep all individual oysters in separate containers, and I won’t be using Resazurin, since the ambient temp Resazurin groups in the first survivorship test still saw high mortality. For the purposes of this second survivorship test, survivorship round 1 will essentially be treated like an additional hardening treatment."

    "text": "Update 8/22\nAs of 8/22 we’re sitting at roughly 50% mortality in the round 2 stressed oysters and roughly 10% mortality in the controls. Interestingly, while there doesn’t appear to be any difference among the original hardening groups, the round 1 survivorship does seem to have had a hardening effect!\nSeveral possible explanations for this observation:\n\nThe original hardening did have an effect, but it was too subtle to see with our reduced sample sizes\nThe original hardening was too long ago – it’s effects were short-term and are no longer manifest, 4 weeks later\nThe original hardening was performed at too low a temperature to see an effect at 42C stress. The original hardening was done at 35C, while survivorship round 1 was at 42C, the same temperature the oysters then experienced during this survivorship round. My brief review of other papers that attempted hardening in bivalves did suggest that hardening was most effective when conditions were similar to those the organism would experience during an extreme stress event post-hardening.\n\n\n\nCode\n#####################\n### Load Packages ###\n#####################\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n#################\n### Load Data ###\n#################\n\nround2 &lt;- read.csv(\"../../../../../Data/Pacific_oysters/2024_08_22_Survivorship_Round2.csv\")\n\n####################\n### Data Munging ###\n####################\n\n# Convert mort_date to Date format\nround2 &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(mort_date = as.Date(mort_date, format=\"%m/%d/%Y\"))\n\n# Calculate the total number of original samples in each group\ngroup_totals &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_samples = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Generate a sequence of dates covering the entire period\ndate_seq &lt;- seq(min(round2$mort_date, na.rm = TRUE), max(round2$mort_date, na.rm = TRUE), by = \"day\")\n# Add the date before start of experiment, to show original 0% mortality\ndate_seq &lt;- c(as.Date(\"2024-08-08\"), date_seq)\n\n# Create a data frame with all combinations of treatment group and date\nround2_full &lt;- expand.grid(group = unique(round2$group), \n                           date = date_seq)\n\n# Aggregate the data by group and date to get daily death counts\nround2_daily &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(group, mort_date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(deaths = n(), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  rename(date = mort_date)\n\n# Join the aggregated daily deaths with the full date range\nround2_cumulative &lt;- round2_full %&gt;%\n  left_join(round2_daily, by = c(\"group\", \"date\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(deaths = ifelse(is.na(deaths), 0, deaths)) %&gt;%  # Replace NA with 0 for days with no deaths\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(cumulative_deaths = cumsum(deaths)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Join with group totals to calculate cumulative deaths as a percentage\nround2_cumulative &lt;- round2_cumulative %&gt;%\n  left_join(group_totals, by = \"group\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(cumulative_death_percentage = (cumulative_deaths / total_samples) * 100)\n\n# retrieve metadata associated with groups\nmetadata &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  select(group, cattle_tag, round1_treatment, round2_treatment) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\nround2_cumulative_metadata &lt;- round2_cumulative %&gt;%\n  left_join(metadata, by = \"group\")\n\n################\n### Plot Data ##\n################\n\nlabels_df &lt;- round2_cumulative_metadata %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  filter(date == max(date)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(round2_cumulative_metadata, aes(x = date, y = cumulative_death_percentage, group = group, color = round1_treatment)) +\n  #geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ round2_treatment) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = labels_df, aes(label = group), size = 2.5, nudge_x = 0.3, check_overlap = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative mortality from Survivorship Round 2\",\n       x = \"Time\",\n       y = \"Cumulative mortality (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceted by Round 2 treatment, color indicates Round 1 treatment (i.e. “second hardening”)"

    "text": "Some notes and pictures from working with the FTR-stored oysters today.\n\nWhite spotting in extreme stress bags\nI noticed some tiny white dots covering portions of some oysters in the extreme stress trial bags (Trial 1 stressed bag, and Trial 2 stressed bag). See pictures below. After talking with Ariana we decided they’re probably just an odd type of tunicate. I rubbed off as much as I could, but I noted there do seem to be tiny holes left below where the dots were. Put the oysters back in the left FTR seawater tank.\n\n\n\n\nDissecting a dip/trip\nMy hardening experiment oysters are a wide range of sizes, so it’s likely I’ll be able to take more detailed tissue samples (e.g., specific tissue types, multiple samples from the same tissue). I want to open a larger oyster to see the anatomy clearly and get a sense of where everything is. I also want to check the reproductive maturity of some oysters from the hatchery.\nTo do this, pulled a large untreated diploid (bag “13”) and large untreated triploid (bag “Bird - Extra”) for dissection.\n\nDiploid\n\nNo developed gonad in the diploid\n\n\n\nThe diploid had some serious shell deterioration, particularly around the hinge. Looks to be the work of some kind of boring parasite that left the shell riddled with orange-something filled holes. The shell broke very easily and separated into layers. Notably, there was no obvious sign of this deterioration on the exterior of the shell.\nTook a look at some of the orange substance under the scope:\n\n\n\n\nTriploid\n\nThe triploid had a developed gonad!\n\n\nTook a gamete sample and examined under the scope:\n\nIt’s female! The eggs seem viable but underdeveloped – many have a vaguely tear-drop shape, rather than a filled-out circle.\nThis is just one diploid and triploid, but it’s interesting that the triploid is the only one with gametes. This could either mean that (a) the “Bird” oysters are not actually triploids, or (b) this is a case of a triploid not actually being sterile. Even though triploids are touted as being sterile, I’ve actually read a few papers noting triploids developing gametes in the field and, relevantly, triploid mortality being associated with fecund triploids!

    "text": "Second trial of an extreme stress test on our extra Pacific oysters. The experimental setup of Trial 1 didn’t work well, and ended up stress the oysters at the sublethal35-38C, instead of a lethal temp of 43C.\nThis time I’ll be using full bucket of water with a heater + thermostat, instead of warming water in the incubator. This should heat the water faster and better regulate the temperature following addition of oysters.\n\nTrial 2 protocol\n\nFilled two clean white plastic buckets with roughly 20L of seawater from the cold seawater tank in FTR. Placed digital thermostats and thermometers in both. To one bucket (the “treatment” bucket), added a rod heater decoupled from the thermostat. Heated the treatment bucket to 43C by manually monitoring the temperature and turning off heater once at temperature.\nNotes: I noticed while heating the treatment bucket that water at the top of the bucket warmed faster than water at the bottom. I added an additional thermostat so that one thermostat sensor was attached to the bottom of the bucket and one was attached the top of the bucket (see pictures). To ensure even heating, I manually mixed the water during heating until the two thermostats were within 1C of each other, repeating whenever the thermostats diverged by more than 1C. Whenever I mixed the treatment bucket, I would also mix the control bucket.\n\n\nIsolated two groups of 10 oysters from bag “13” (untreated diploid), selecting similarly sized sets of oysters, and placed in small mesh bags. Randomly assigned one bag to treatment and one to control. Labelled each with a labelled 15mL tube placed inside bag and colored zip ties attached to the bag (didn’t have any waterproof bag tags). Yellow and black is 43C group, blue and black is control. Measured length of each oyster in each group using a manual caliper, then placed back in respective labelled bags and placed bags in cold seawater tank for roughly 1hr\nNotes: Noticed a few dead oysters in the source bag “13”, all on the small side.\n\n\n\nOnce the treatment seawater bucket was at 43C, I began the stress trial. I placed the “treatment” bag of oysters in the 43C bucket, and the “control” bag of oysters in the bucket of ambient water (roughly 17C). The oysters remained in their respective buckets for 1 hr (16:30 - 17:30, 7/15/2024).\nI maintained the treatment water temperature of 43C by manually monitoring the thermostats and thermometer. When any of these temperature gauges dropped below 42C (a 1C variation) I turned the heater back on until all three temperature gauges were again at 43C. I also mixed the water the entire time the heater was on, to ensure even heating, and ensured the bag of oysters was not touching the heating element itself. I had to turn the heater on roughly every 15 minutes to maintain temperature.\nNotes: The thermostat whose sensor was at the top of the treatment bucket consistently displayed a temperature 1C below the thermostat placed at the bottom of the bucket. I’m not sure if this is because the top layer of water lost heat faster or because of a calibration difference in the thermostats. This means, however, that a drop below 42C in the top thermostat generally meant a drop to 42C in the bottom of the bucket, which means water at the bottom of the bucket likely never dropped below 42C.\nAfter the 1hr treatment, placed both bags of oysters back in the cold seawater tank in FTR.\nUnplugged all heaters and thermostats, emptied both buckets of seawater into the drains in the seawater room, and rinsed both with DI water.\nMonitor oysters in both groups for mortality once per day at roughly noon for the next 2 weeks. To check mortality, remove bag of oysters from tank, empty bag onto table. An empty shell or gaping with no response to stimulation (prodding with metal tool) indicates mortality.\n\n\n\nMortality\nChecked bags daily at roughly noon for mortality. Mortality evaluated by prodding oysters and squeezing lightly at base of hinge. Empty shells or oysters that gaped and remained open during stimulation were considered dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTime\nControl (mm length of dead oyster(s))\nExtreme stress (mm length of dead oyster(s))\n\n\n\n\n7/16\n12:30\n-\n25, 27\n\n\n7/17\n\n\n\n\n\n7/18\n\n\n\n\n\n7/19\n\n\n\n\n\n7/20"

This time I wanted to try oysters at a range of sizes. Selected 3 oysters of a range of sizes from both the “13” diploid cohort and the “Bird” triploid cohort (untreated). Placed each oyster in 700mL of algae-rich seawater (sourced from black tub and diluted until algae content was just below the quantifiable level of 199 ug/L using the FluoroSense fluorometer). Monitored for ~1hr at roughly 10min intervals. Took triplicate fluorometer readings each time.\nSee data entered here, or original data in the below notebook photos.\n\n\n\nNote: values shown are the third of each set of triplicate measurements from each time point (column “Fluoro3” in the raw datasheet)\n\n\nAs expected, the small oysters (13 26mm and Bird 24mm) have a much lower clearance rate. Interestingly though, all of the larger oysters (13 75mm, 13 88mm, Bird 61mm, and Bird 76mm) see to have pretty similar clearance rates, with the Bird 61mm oyster actually beating the others at most time points!\n\n\n\nTrial 3 oysters. “Bird” triploid untreated (top) and “13” diploid untreated (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial 3 setup\n\n\nOverall, since the fluorometer is non-invasive and very easy to use, it seems like the best option may just be to measure clearance rate of the full cohorts (i.e. place the full treatment bags in algae-rich water and monitor feeding). The oysters don’t always open to feed and the fluorometer doesn’t seem sensitive/consistent enough to use with smaller sample sizes.\nUnfortunately the FluoroSense fluorometer stopped working at roughly 15:15. It’s only displaying 0 readings, even for my control solution which was consistently reading at ~180 and was visibly clouded with algae. Matt and I tried recalibrating the fluorometer using the 800ppb Rhodamine calibration solution, but saw no change. There’s no visible damage, the display is functioning normally, and the blue fluorescence light is still working as usual, so I’m really not sure what the issue is :(\n\n\n\nNotebook photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUcar/ferry reciepts"

See photos of the datasheets below and digital spreadsheets here.\nObservations:\nThe diploids were generally a bit bigger, there were more oysters larger than the desired size range (20mm - 60mm), and there were more dead oysters. There were also several instances in both groups of two oysters fused together, and these were excluded from the oysters compiled for the experiment.6\nLength summary stats (mm):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBag\nSample size\nMin\nMax\nRange\nMean\nMedian\n\n\ntriploid control\n100\n23\n65\n42\n35.62\n34\n\n\ntriploid treatment\n100\n23\n54\n31\n32.47\n30\n\n\ndiploid control\n100\n18\n60\n42\n37.42\n36\n\n\ndiploid treatment\n100\n21\n65\n44\n39.77\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBags are green mesh, and were labelled with a number (Bag 1, Bag 2, Bag 3, Bag 4), ploidy (triploid or diploid), and treatment group (control or treatment), as well as the identifier “UW-KD, Roberts” to distinguish our bags from others in the hatchery.

After a hardening session they will be placed back in the ambient tanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature: 35C\nTime: 4 hours per session\nFrequency: 3 times/week for two weeks. Choosing to do hardening sessions on Monday, Wednesday, Friday for convenience.\n\n\n\n\nFirst hardening session on Wednesday, 06/26/2024, performed by Steven.\nSecond hardening session on Friday, 06/28/2024, will be performed by Ariana.\nI think the rest (Mon 07/01/2024, Wed 07/03/2024, Fri 07/05/2024, Mon 07/08/2024) will be done by me.\n\n\n\nUCar rental/mileage details\nQuick overview of Ucar rental and ferry reciepts.

In other words, it would cost the same. Since The ferry route saves some time and involves less driving, I’m going to stick with it."

I guess it wouldn’t be super useful as a preemptive indicator of resiliance/preparedness/tolerance, since changes to aerobic metabolism happen during stress\n\nlow-moderate stress (pejus): Compensation. Accelerated metabolism/ATP turnover to provide additional energy in support of cellular maintenance/damage repair, and accompanying increase in feeding or changes in energy allocation. Also often fueled by utilizing energy stores (e.g. glycogen and lipid stores).\nextreme stress (pessimism): Conservation. Slow-down of metabolism and physiological activity to conserve energy resources and reduce accumulation of intracellular waste from compensatory activity. All available energy devoted to somatic maintenance, rather than growth, reproduction, or storage. In extreme cases, may enter metabolically arrested state, temporarily suppressing activity below maintenance levels to conserve energy until normal function becomes possible. This metabolic arrest is particularly common in animals native to extreme environments (e.g. the intertidal)"

I also always assign the tag “unread,” and then change it to “read” once I’ve finished reading/annotating.\nHowever, Zotero doesn’t have an easy way to view the tags, notes, or some types of metadata associated with multiple papers at the same time. Since I’m a very visual person, I want a way to view, sort, and search the key information from all of my papers at the same time. After asking for suggestions in the lab Slack, Chris sent me a Sheets template that I’ve been testing out!\n\n\nStep 2: Google Sheets\nOriginal template (from Chris)\nMy current document\nMy current setup for this document looks like this:\n\n\nThe metadata recorded in the Sheets document is a little redundant because all of my papers are already stored in my Zotero library, but it ensures I’m recording information for the right paper.\nHere’s a look at all of the options for the different categorical variables:\n\n\nWith these options I can search by project, study type, and relevance, and keep track of how thoroughly I’ve read a source in my library.\nI’m still in the early stages of implementing this document, but so far I really like it! While I was brainstorming the oyster project experimental design I had to reference a few papers and the Sheets document made it much easier to quickly go through many papers and the information I’d identified as most helpful, without having to individually click on each paper to view its associated metadata/notes. I still need to transfer everything i currently have in my Zotero library to the Sheets doc, but I think having this system in place before I really get into the weeds of reading dozens/hundreds of papers for thesis writing will be super helpful!"

Study something similar in oysters (if their life history makes sense)? Interesting to think about possible epigenetic mismatch of gametes…\nstudy set of multiple stressors and/or multiple generations on methylation/expression/phenotype/etc. (e.g. Feiner et al. 2022, set of chemical and thermal environmental stressors on daphnia to investigate epigenetic heritability)\nIn same daphnia paper (Feiner er al. 2022), saw responses to naturally occurring stressors were more inherited than those to non-naturally occurring ones — possible suggestion of underlying preadaptation towards certain epigenetic modifications that helps allow them to be passed on successfully and retained?\nkeep in mind MHW conditions (sudden dramatic swings), not just slow warming creep of climate crisis\nIf epigeneitc modification is heritable, what are epigenetic impacts of releasing captive/bred stock back into wild?\nIs it possible to study gene expression/methylation/ncRNA in ancient DNA?

    "text": "Questions\n\nNeed to look more into epigenetic reprogramming – how does it work, mechanistically? How does it differ among taxa, especially between model organisms and inverts? How would it differ among sexual reproduction and the many forms of asexual reproduction?\nHeritability of ncRNA-related epigenetic changes?\nWhile reading George et al. 2023, I noticed they used heat shock to induce triploidy in their Pacific oysters (referenced Yamamoto et al. 1988, which showed you can apply a heat shock of 35*C to 20*C-acclimated larvae during meiosis to induce triploidy). Raised the question of whether this can/does happen in the wild? And if it’s possible to achieve triploidy-inducing heat shock conditions in the wild, does that mean that climate change/increased incidence of MHW will begin shifting wild oyster populations to more triploids, and thus affect fertility/reproductive viability of wild pops?\nA common way of producing triploid oyster stocks nowadays is crossing tetraploid and diploid oysters (genertes 100% triploid offspring without the mortality associated with heat-shock or chemically induced triploidy). We know that induced-triploids are less robust to temperature/aerial exposure stress than diploids (George et al. 2023). Is it possible that, in induced triploids, the heat/chemical shock at an early life stage epigenetically “primes” them poorly? Epigenetic modifications and genetic adaptations to stress are heritable, though, so how do tetraploidXdiploid triploids fare under stress conditions, and can this be modulated by the acclimation/adaptation of the parents?\nDuring some preliminary lit review on Pacific cod and MHW related mortality, I read that overall warming and early-year MHWs can affect the timing of marine primary production (e.g. phytoplankton reproduction and abundance). Oysters feed on phytoplankton through filter feeding – does that mean that, as oceans warm, oysters may be facing more starvation stress? Especially if there ends up being a “mismatch” of spawning and primary production?\nDoes polyploidy affect the way you analyze and compare gene expression data? Since a triploid would have an extra set of chromosomes, could that affect number of transcripts even if [# transcripts expressed per chromosome] didnt change?"

So far they haven’t seen any direct effect on the anemone host or anemone fertility/reproduction, which we might normally expect based on role of estrogen in vertebrates. There was, however, a significant effect on the symbiont populations – in presence of estrogen, symbionts were increasingly photosynthetically efficient – woah! The effect was so strong that they could actually see differences in the color of the water the anemones were held in because of increased levels of algae in the water. Increasing estrogen levels led to this gradient of increasingly green water 😮. Also touched on studying impact of sediment suspension (affects symbiont productivity and/or polyp feeding?)\nWe also talked a bit about the possibility of coral polyps in the same aggregate colony sharing the “symbiont load,” and related nutrients, which could explain when some species have “patchy” symbiont distribution around colony. Apparently there’s a kind of plant that grows in/near salty water and, to rid itself of excess salt, basically picks a leaf to die and sends all the salt there, leaving the rest of the plant healthy. Maybe similar stuff happens in corals?"

Basically, maybe the combination of MHW and differing egg/sperm developmental timelines are causing egg/sperm mismatch when spawning happens!\nEggs take a long time to develop and start in late summer, and thus are already in development during MHW/bleaching events. Sperm, however, as “cheap” and don’t start developing until March, so never experience bleaching before the spawning season in early summer. That means that, during spawning, you can end up with bleaching-affected eggs trying to match with unstressed sperm – maybe that “mismatch” is causing problems!\nBred bleached (B) and non-bleached (NB) corals. Found that BxB corals and NBxNB corals were most successful in larval development, while BxNB and NBxB corals didn’t do as well. Support for this possible mismatch problem\nWhile I’m sure this is at least partially because of bleaching-related stress effects of the viability of the eggs or something similar, this is making me think about the possible role of epigenetics here. We know that environmental conditions can be associated with epigenetic modifications like methylation, and that such epigenetic modifications can also take place in the gametes and thus become heritable. Is it possible that there are epigenetic modifications happening in the eggs during these bleaching events that are not happening to the sperm, and that this “mismatch” of the epigenome is less successful that the combination of two stress-modified gametes (BxB) or of two non-modified gametes (NBxNB)?\n\nAssessing physiological and molecular plasticity in the early stages of Porites astreoides (Florence Fields)\nIntraspecific variation in thermal tolerance in the endangered Caribbean coral, Acropora palmata (Holland Elder)\n\nKeep in mind bleaching, like other stress reponses, is continuous, not binary!\n\nThe butterfly(fish) effect: Using Caetodontidae territories as bioindicators (Corrine Avidan)\nMicrobial predictors of bleacing in Great Barrier Reef Acropora millepora (Karim Primov)\nIron wars over ligand soup: Exploring chemical crosstalk in Symbiodiniaceae-bacteria interactions (Hannah Reich)\n\nBacteria can help eukaryotic partners (like algae) access hard-to-get iron\nPossible connection here to Callum’s talk about impacts of heavy metal contamination on coral/holobiont?\n\nEnvironmental drivers of coral-associated algal and microbial communities across multiple scales (Coleen Bove)"

    "text": "In the process of running kallisto on the three E5 deep dive species, we realized that there’s no transcriptome FASTA available for P. evermanni. That means we need to generate one!\nRendered code\nRelated posts:\nRNAseq abundance quantification (A.Pulchra, P.evermanni, P.meandrina)\nP.evermanni RNAseq kallisto debugging\nTesting bedtools: gff vs bed input file\n\nStarter files\nThe closest file to a P. evermanni transcriptome that we have is a P.evermanni coding sequence (CDS) gff file, and a corresponding genome scaffolds FASTA.\nhead of gff:\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove mRNA 3107 4488 543 - .

Parent=Peve_00000001\nA gff file lists information that can be used to identify and retrieve specific sequences. The first column lists the region or scaffold of a reference genome in which the sequence can be found; the third identifies which genomic feature (e.g., mRNA, CDS, UTR) the sequence is; and the fourth and fifth are genomic coordinates for the beginning and end of the sequence. Since we have both the coding sequences gff and a reference fasta, we should be able to extract FASTA sequences for all of the relevant sequences in the gff!\n\n\nExtract CDS sequences\nFirst, it looks like the gff has features labelled a little weirdly. Normally we’d want all of the mRNA sequences, but it looks like this file lists mRNA sequences that include introns. Instead, we want all of the CDS sequences associated with each mRNA (association is denoted in the final column with a parent mRNA ID, e.g. “Parent=Peve_00000001”). That means the first step is to extract all of the CDS sequences from our gff file.\n\n# Extract only the CDS sequence lines from the gff\ngrep -w 'CDS' ${transcriptome_gff} &gt; ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\n\nhead -n 5 ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\n\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove   CDS 3107    3444    .   -   .

Parent=Peve_00000002\n\n\nConvert gff to bed\nThen we convert this filtered CDS gff file to a bed file, which has slightly different formatting. We’re doing this because we’ll be using a tool called bedtools getfasta, which can take both gff and bed files, but which I trust more to appropriately parse bed files (though, see post on whether it can handle gff files correctly as well).\n\n# Ensure bedops can find its dependencies when running\nexport PATH=/home/shared/bedops_linux_x86_64-v2.4.41/bin:$PATH\n\n${bedops}/gff2bed \\\n--do-not-sort \\\n&lt; ${transcriptome_gff_filtered} \\\n&gt; ${transcriptome_bed}\n\nhead -n 3 ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\necho \"\"\nhead -n 3 ${transcriptome_bed}\n\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove   CDS 3107    3444    .   -   .

Parent=Peve_00000002\n\n\nGenerating a transcriptome FASTA\nThe basic approach to generating this transcriptome makes use of the fact that each CDS sequence in our bed file is assigned a “parent” mRNA, denoted by a parent Id in the last column (e.g., “Parent=Peve_00000001”). Each sequence with the same parent ID should be used to a) retrieve a FASTA for that sequence, and b) concatenate all of the FASTAs with the same parent ID into a single, labelled gene FASTA. The below code will iterate through our entire bed file and do this for each parent ID and its associated sequences.\n\n# Load bash variables into memory\nsource .bashvars\n\n# Navigate to correct directory and make output file\ncd ${transcriptome_dir}\necho &gt; ${transcriptome_fasta_name}\n\n# Helper list for processing all parent IDs\nprocessed_ids=()\n\n######################################################\n\n# Helper function to concatenate and format several bedtools output sequences \n# into a single, appropriately named contig\nconcatenate_helper() {\n    local input_bedtools_fastas=\"$1\"\n    local parent_ID=\"$2\"\n    local reference_name=\"\"\n    local positions=\"\"\n    local concatenated_sequences=\"\"\n\n    # Read the input line by line\n    while IFS= read -r line; do\n        # Check if the line starts with \"&gt;\"\n        if [[ \"$line\" == \"&gt;\"* ]]; then\n            # Extract reference name and position from the line\n            reference_position=\"${line:1}\"  # Remove \"&gt;\"\n            reference_name=$(echo \"$reference_position\" | cut -d: -f1)\n            position=$(echo \"$reference_position\" | cut -d: -f2)\n\n            # Append position to the positions variable\n            positions+=\"$position,\"\n        else\n            # Concatenate sequences\n            concatenated_sequences+=\"$line\"\n        fi\n    done &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$input_bedtools_fastas\"\n\n    # Remove trailing comma from positions\n    positions=\"${positions%,}\"\n\n    # Output the reformatted result\n    echo \"&gt;$parent_ID $reference_name:$positions\"\n    echo \"$concatenated_sequences\"\n}\n\n######################################################\n\n# Process your input bed file\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n\n    # pull the parent ID number for the current line of the bed\n    parentID=$(echo \"$line\" | grep -o 'Parent=Peve_[0-9]\\+')\n    \n    # Only continue if you haven't already processed the CDS sequences associated with this parent ID\n    if [[ ! \" ${processed_ids[@]} \" =~ \" $parentID \" ]]; then\n \n        # Add the current parentID to the processed list\n        processed_ids+=(\"$parentID\")\n\n        # Create temporary files to store intermediate results\n        temp_CDS_bed_file=$(mktemp)\n        temp_bedtools_fasta_file=$(mktemp)\n\n        # Grab all of the CDS sequences with the same parent ID and write to temporary file\n        grep \"$parentID\" ${transcriptome_bed} &gt; \"$temp_CDS_bed_file\"\n\n        # Use bedtools to extract corresponding FASTAs and write to temporary file\n        ${programs_array[bedtools]} getfasta -fi ${genome_fasta} -bed \"$temp_CDS_bed_file\" -fo \"$temp_bedtools_fasta_file\"\n\n        # Use our helper function to concatenate and format all of these CDS fastas into a single contig\n        concatenated_fasta=$(concatenate_helper \"$(cat \"$temp_bedtools_fasta_file\")\" \"$parentID\")\n \n        # Add the concatenated CDS fasta to our output file on a new line\n        echo \"$concatenated_fasta\" &gt;&gt; ${transcriptome_fasta}\n\n        # Remove the temporary files\n        rm \"$temp_CDS_bed_file\" \"$temp_bedtools_fasta_file\"\n    fi\ndone &lt; ${transcriptome_bed}\n\n# The output file ends up having a blank first line before the data, so delete that unwanted empty first line\nsed -i '1{/^$/d}' ${transcriptome_fasta}\n\nNow we have a transcriptome FASTA the can be used for kallisto abundance quantification!"

    "text": "I’m currently trying to quantify RNA abundances using RNAseq data from the three E5 deep dive species, and I’m running into some issues for P. evermanni.\nLinks:\n\ncode (.Rmd)\nknitted file (.md)\ngithub issue\n\nThere’s no published transcriptome fasta for P. evermanni, so instead I’m using a published CDS gff file and associated scaffold genome fasta to assemble a de novo reference transcriptome fasta.\nI first used bedtools getfasta to extract fasta sequences for everything listed in the original CDS gff file, but ended up with duplicate sequences, which interferes with kallisto indexing. While trying (and failing) to remove duplicates with the fastx_toolkit fastx_collapser, Steven pointed out that the gff file (image below) I’m using contains sequences labeled as both CDS and mRNA sequences, and suggested I use only those labeled as mRNA.\n\nI selected only sequecnes labelled as “mRNA” in the gff, extracted those sequences fastas from the scaffold reference, and was able to successfully build a kallisto index, however I was given a warning that kallisto index had identified 10,722,052 non-ACGUT characters in the 40,389 input sequences (or ~265 non-ACGUT characters per sequence!). Quickly looking through some of the extracted sequence fastas, I found some of them contain long internal stretches of N characters.\n\nSam was able to inform me that this is due to the reference fasta I’m using to extract mRNA fastas. The reference is a scaffold, which characteristically contains arbitrary stretches of Ns connecting known sequences to others in the same region. Steven then also noticed that the gff file seems to be improperly labeled, with mRNA sequences that actually contain several CDS regions and introns, which could interfere with pseudoalignment. Instead, of using the labelled mRNAs, I may need to extract all the sequences labelled as CDS from the gff, obtain sequences fastas, group and concatenate by “Parent” (source mRNA) to exclude all of the introns, and then use those concatenated CDS fasta sequences as a reference for kallisto.\nSome pseudo code for doing this:\nstart with original.gff, which contains CDS, mRNA, UTR, etc. sequences\ngrep -w \"CDS\" original.gff &gt; filtered.gff\nnow I have a filtered gff that only contains info for CDS sequences in a format that looks like:\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000002\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000002\n…\nwhere each Parent ID (“Parent=Peve_00000001”) groups together CDS sequences that originate from the same mRNA. To get full concatenated fasta sequences for each mRNA I’ll do:\nfor i in #LinesInFiltered.gff:\n\n  get parentID of filtered.gff line i\n\n  if parentID not already in final.fasta:\n\n    extract all lines in filtered.gff with parentID\n    bedtools to get each lines' fasta sequence\n    concatenate all of these fastas\n    assign appropriate ID that includes parentID to concatenated fasta\n    add this parentID.fasta to final.fasta\nthis final.fasta should contain the same number of sequence fastas as unique parentIDs in filtered.gff"

It wouldn’t work perfectly just subbing in a different list of sequences to current workflow. Star sequences are getting blast hits to the sets of stars associated with already known conserved mature miRNAs, and I’m not exactly sure how I might want to change the filtering to get what I want. After manually investigating it in Google sheets though, it looks like including star sequences wouldn’t have a huge impact. Instead of 4 miRNAs conserved in all three species and 1/1/1 for each pair of species, including stars as possible mature miRNA sequences would shift the conserved counts to 5 miRNAs in all three species and 0/1/1 for the Apul-Peve, Apul-Pmea, and Peve-Pmea pairs."

Triploid summer mortality is the big concern, so it would be useful to have some way to “diagnose” stress in the field, informing farms when/how they need to adjust their setups to avoid mass mortality (e.g., adding feed, moving bags to reduce density, shifting to cooler waters, bring into hatchery(?), etc.). Stress “priming” is also a way that hatcheries could preemptively prepare stock for stressful events. Maybe a cool tweak to the project would be to start with diploid/triploid larvae, prime some (but not others), raise to adulthood, and outplant to see how they do in the field. Throughout, measure some set of physiological features (e.g., respiration) to quantify stress and try to develop some assay of biomarkers indicative of stress/impending mortality. Could still do temp and nutrition stress\nI also really like the idea that Sarah suggested about making notebook posts for specific topics when I do a deep dive into the literature on a specific thing, plus her notebook has some really cool features, so I think I’m going to try to implement some of those!"

Probably doesn’t affect end result of kallisto much, since it’s pseudoaligning full reads, but still need to fix it. Should be a straightforward fix, the biggest pain will be waiting another 4 hours for the adjusted transcriptome generation code to run again😭\nDid a quick and dirty test using both a gff and a bed file as input to bedtools getfasta and both resulted in the same output, suggesting bedtools does appropriately differentiate between the formats!

It ran much quicker this time around and resulted in a much smaller output file, which means one of the two times I ran the script something was wrong.

I was also able to log in to my new Gannet account and get it set up, so I should (theoretically) be able to store large files there now. I’m still not 100 sure how I would do that though. I’ve read through some old Github issues and stuff and I think I’d need to either ssh or rsync to connect to Gannet from Raven and then copy over the large files using that connection. I’m not not familiar with rsync, so I’m not sure what the difference between ssh and rsync is or which is preferable. I also am not 100% sure what the server host name/IP address would be to ssh into Gannet, but I’m guessing I can use the IP that Gannet emailed to me. Since I’m not confident in correctly connecting and copying to Gannet from Raven I haven’t uploaded the blast/annotation output files or pushed anything from running the rmd to github. I’ll either ask about it in lab tomorrow or Science Hour on Friday.\nI’m also still not sure what a lot of the code from Steven’s blast/annotation code is doing, so I want to do a deep-dive into the commands being run.\nLastly, I finally took a moment to try registering for SICB only to find out I don’t have access to the College of Environment purchasing system, Treq. I requested access through the indicated email and will ask about it during Friday Science Hour if I don’t hear back by then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several weeks of accumulating issues with running command line and working in RStudio/Github (both locally and on Raven), I think I’ve finally resolved them all! I was able to run the tutorial blast code successfully (I think). I still want to figure out/ask about the function of all the parameters called (e.g. -evalue 1E-20), and to figure out how to interpret the output results (or at least learn how to identify possible issues in the output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevelations from lab meeting today! Several of my Raven problems were solved during our raven/github-focused meeting today – notes below:\n\nConnecting Raven with my Github. I needed to enter\n```{bash} git config –global user.email \"[mygithubemailthatIdon'twanttopublicize]\"   git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"```\nand then log in to git using my username and a personal access token (which I have now created). I’m now fully connected to github from Raven and have successfully pushed/pulled!\nGetting/accessing ncbi blast software on Raven. Blast is indeed already downloaded and accessible on Raven, it’s just in a higher-level directory that I couldn’t find because I didn’t know about it (I can only default view my home directory on Raven). The higher-level lab directory is /home/shared, and ncbi-blast v. 2.12.0 is already installed there!\nPushing large files to Github. Don’t! Any file (e.g. output file) sizes larger than 100MB should not be pushed to Github - instead, put it on Gannet (another lab server intended for large-file-size data and output storage). Already github-issued Sam/Steven to ask for access to Gannet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter fairly continuous head-bashing (pun intended ;) ) with RStudio/bash/blast for the last two weeks I’m kind of tired of it, so today I’m going to focus on other stuff – like setting some goals! I’ve had ~3 weeks now to get settled into the lab and Steven and I have had the chance to talk about possible directions for the near future, so let’s put some stuff in writing – see October Goals post for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI continued trying to figure out how to work in Raven today and ran into another fun problem – my Raven RStudio isn’t connected to my github, even though I copied the directory I’m working in directly from Github in the same way I would copy a repo to RStudio on my local machine. I realized I wasn’t able to commit or push/pull, and using the command ```{bash} git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"``` didn’t fix the issue. It clearly isn’t an issue with my shell script/terminal because I’ve been successfully running command line code on Raven. Maybe Raven isn’t supposed to end up tied to github? I would think the code and stuff should all end up on github for backup/reproducibility purposes, but I can also see why sending some things to github (e.g. output files) could require an unreasonable amount of storage…\nI also managed to modify the 001-blast.Rmd tutorial script to download a windows version of ncbi blast to Raven and run the .exe, but I wasn’t able to successfully access the blast.exe component used in the first task of the tutorial file (setting blast directory). Neither I nor google can figure out why with a cursory search and I unfortunately have class soon, but in the worst case I can bring this up at lab meeting on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam was able to resend me login credentials for Raven (the Lab’s primary server, implemented through a browser version of RStudio), so I started getting situated on it. Since I have a pending task related to blasting a cod transcriptome, I copied over my github repo RobertsLab_OnboardingTasks and took another look at the blast tutorial .Rmd file (001-blast.Rmd). The last time I tried to run this tutorial file (on RStudio locally) I ran into problems running bash through RStudio at all.\nThankfully that isn’t an issue working in Raven, but now I’m kind of stumped because of the need to download and run blast. I can’t find any “higher level” directories above my own Raven account that might hold relevant software like ncbi-blast, but it seems weird that I’d need to individually download the software for use on a shared server…The code included in the tutorial file for this also wouldn’t work on my machine, since it’s written with Mac-specific and outdated versions of blast. I downloaded the most recent Windows version of blast to my local machine, but I don’t think I can access local software from Raven since it’s a server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finished the cod temp/growth analysis assigned by Steven\n\n\n\nI’m still having issues with the disconnect between which shell script is being used by my terminal and which is used by console in R. We realized today that my problems pushing my analysis code to the lab’s project-cod-temperature repo on github were related to the disconnect problem. I was able to pull and push to github when I was working within the repo on RStudio, but I couldn’t commit using the Git environment in the upper right pane. However, pushing, pulling, and committing manually from the terminal all worked fine. We think that, somehow, the commit action in the Git environment is using the same faulty WSL shell that my console is defaulting to, even though the push/pull actions are correctly defaulting to Git Bash. To make matters even more confusing, when I’m working within my lab notebook repo in RStudio I’m able to push, pull, and commit successfully from the Git environment with no issues. Why is my default shell script for console/some parts of git different between repos/RStudio projects?\nNo answers yet, but for right now I’m still able to maintain functionality while working locally because the terminal is functioning appropriately and I have a workaround to run bash code chunks included in Rmd files (see Oct.12 post).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I may have fixed the issue running bash code chunks in Rmd files! Included the following:\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(bash='C:/Program Files/Git/git-bash.exe'))\n\nAnd now, while I still don’t seem to get any output when I try to run individual code chunks by pressing the “play” button in the top right corner, knitting the document works! I still haven’t figured out how to permanently set the default shell script for running bash code chunks from Rmd files (checking default shell using “Sys.which(”bash”)” from the console still returns “C::\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe” aka WSL), so for now I guess I’ll just have to include that YAML block in any Rmd file I’m working in.\nStarted working on cod temp/size data analysis assigned by Steven but haven’t been able to push to the lab Github repo (project-cod-temperature) bc, while I successfully cloned the repo to RStudio, I haven’t been able to connect them so I’m able to push changes back to it. Will ask about it during Science Hour tomorrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve continued trying to troubleshoot my issues with running bash code chunks in .Rmd files. Running Sys.which(“bash”) in the RStudio console the path “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe”, which I think is bash installed as a part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started looking at the github tasks Steven assigned me to familiarize me with Raven and the lab’s computing practices (analyzing some weight/temp data and BLASTing/annotating a transcriptome), but quickly ran into setup issues. I made a new github repo using the lab’s project template and tried running through one of the blast tutorials included in the project template, but immediately had problems with running the bash code chunks. I’ve done command-line data analysis work before, but never through an Rmarkdown file or in RStudio. When I tried to run any of the bash code chunks nothing would happen, not even an error output. First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin? I’ll try more troubleshooting tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted an additional employee training and went over my lit review questions (see Oct.5 entry) with Steven. Also github-issued Sam about getting added to Raven.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\n\nA: adenine is only methylated in certain taxa (e.g. bacteria), and isn’t methylated in marine inverts\n\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable? Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\nA: Differs among taxa.

I’ve read through some old Github issues and stuff and I think I’d need to either ssh or rsync to connect to Gannet from Raven and then copy over the large files using that connection. I’m not not familiar with rsync, so I’m not sure what the difference between ssh and rsync is or which is preferable. I also am not 100% sure what the server host name/IP address would be to ssh into Gannet, but I’m guessing I can use the IP that Gannet emailed to me. Since I’m not confident in correctly connecting and copying to Gannet from Raven I haven’t uploaded the blast/annotation output files or pushed anything from running the rmd to github. I’ll either ask about it in lab tomorrow or Science Hour on Friday.\nI’m also still not sure what a lot of the code from Steven’s blast/annotation code is doing, so I want to do a deep-dive into the commands being run.\nLastly, I finally took a moment to try registering for SICB only to find out I don’t have access to the College of Environment purchasing system, Treq.

I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful."

First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin?

Is it even necessary?\nSo Zhu et al. 2022 found symbiont-associated miRNAs in coral transcriptome, but also mentioned in intro that (in other studies) foreign miRNA presence was correlated with intake (e.g. when human ate certain plant associated miRNAs present in human serum, but would disappear if they stopped eating that plant). Does that mean that presence/function of symbiont miRNAs in corals change when the coral is bleached (aka, the symbionts are gone)?

In contrast to DNA, where all of the different introns/exons, etc. are contained in one long strand of DNA, I thought transcribed RNAs were separate molecules. If that’s the case my understanding on how we sequence miRNAs is that we isolate all the RNAs of a very small size (20-30bp) and then sequence them – why, then, would trimming (beyond removing the adapters that facilitate enrichment) be necessary?

I backed up all my work to Gannet, then undid all my local commits, and recommitted/pushed only the .gitignore file. Once it was pushed, I reran my code to generate all the outputs again, and was able to successfully commit and push.

Not yet 😕.\n✓ Read up on E5 coral project and start to get settled in it. Getting there! I’ve started reading up on ncRNAs and, while I had to miss the last two meetings of the E5 group because of a midterm and a function required for one of my scholarships, I’ll be meeting with the working group tomorrow morning.\n✓ Get registered for SICB.

This feels basic, but considering the myriad difficulties I’ve had with RStudio/Github/Raven/bash/blast over the last few weeks, something tells me it won’t be :/\nRead up on the cod temperature/growth project. I’m going to be sticking with this project for a while, so I want to get a better background understanding of project goals, methodology, and data collection/processing to-date. I’m really excited to be working on an experimental project, since my previous work has all used broad survey data from various sample collection trips and museum collections! This project may also involve more wetwork, which I’d be really excited to get my hands on – as much as I love coding, I’m already missing the lab a bit.\nRead up on E5 coral project and start to get settled in it. I’m also going to be joining the E5 coral project – returning to my coral background! (Technically my background is in soft corals not stony, but details details details). I’ve already looked through the E5 coral website a few times, but I want to do a deeper dive once I know exactly what aspect of the project I’m going to be working on (maybe short RNAs?)\nGet registered for SICB. That’s it :)"

In this step, kallisto takes your reference transcriptome as input and breaks each transcript into “k-mers,” or shorter sequences that are k nucleotides long. It then “indexes” these k-mers, storing each k-mer and its transcript association in a data structure for more efficient retrieval during the pseudoalignment step.\n\n\nSample quantification\nNext is quantification, which take both the index you just constructed and your trimmed RNAseq read, and makes use of pseudoalignment, a process that is much faster and more efficient than aligning each full read to a full transcript. Briefly, each read is broken up into k-mers, which are then mapped to the index to see which indexed transcript k-mers may match the read k-mers. Kallisto then calculates a probability score for each read/transcript pair, evaluating the likelihood that a given read originated from each transcript. These scores are then used to estimate transcript abundance.\n\n\nBuild count matrix for all samples\nThe kallisto quantification process can only take one sample (i.e., one pair of reads) at a time, so as a last step we build a counts matrix that lists the transcript abundances for all of our samples in a single file.\n\n\nSummary\nA. pulchra:\nsample 140 – 47M reads processed (61.4% mapped)\nsample 145 – 42M reads processed (65.3% mapped)\nsample 150 – 43M reads processed (47.0% mapped)\nsample 173 – 47M reads processed (60.7% mapped)\nsample 178 – 42M reads processed (59.3% mapped)\n\nP. evermanni:\nsample 71 – 50M reads processed (35.3% mapped)\nsample 73 – 51M reads processed (29.8% mapped)\nsample 76 – 49M reads processed (35.6% mapped)\nsample 79 – 49M reads processed (31.9% mapped)\nsample 82 – 48M reads processed (37.3% mapped)\nP. meandrina:\nsample 47 – 54M reads processed (26.1% mapped)\nsample 48 – 51M reads processed (25.3% mapped)\nsample 50 – 55M reads processed (31.1% mapped)\nsample 53 – 53M reads processed (31.8% mapped)\nsample 57 – 42M reads processed (21.7% mapped)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "See E5 deep-dive Github issue #49\nWhile looking at ShortStack database matches, for the three species I realized that all three have matches to multiple published sequences of miR-2030, but miR-2030 was not one of the miRNAs identified as conserved between the three species. After poking around I realized that the Apul miR-2030 miRNA and Peve miR-2030 have identical mature miRNA sequences, but the Pmea miR-2030 has a totally different mature sequence. Instead, the star sequence of Pmea miR-2030 matches the mature sequences for Apul miR-2030 and Peve miR-2030. This raises the possibility that ShortStack is incorrectly distinguishing between mature and star sequences, which would throw a bit of a wrench in the current workflow to identify conserved miRNAs. I also noted something similar when comparing ShortStack outputs to the miRdeep2 output.\n\n\nAs a reminder, miRNAs originate as primary miRNA transcripts (“pri-miRNAs”) transcribed from genes, which are characteristically folded in a “hairpin” structure. These pri-miRNAs are then cleaved at their base to form precursor miRNAs (“pre-miRNAs”). The pre-miRNA loop is then removed by Dicer, leaving a mature miRNA duplex. Both of these strands (5’ and 3’) can be loaded into an Argonaute (AGO) protein complex to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which then guides gene expression. However, one strand is usually preferentially loaded, in part based on its thermodynamic stability. Strands that are not loaded are unwound from their complement and generally degraded by cellular machinery. The preferentially-loaded strand is commonly titled the “mature miRNA,” while the unloaded strand is commonly called the “miRNA*” or “miRNA star”. Since the AGO-loaded strand (mature miRNA) is the one that actually influences gene expression, this is the strand that is considered important during miRNA identification and analysis. (Summarized from (O’Brien et al. 2018))\n\n\n\nmiRNA biogenisis (Tomari and Zamore 2005)\n\n\nIt isn’t entirely clear from the ShortStack documentation how it distinguishes between mature and star sequences. What sequence features would indicate one strand is more likely to be loaded on to the RISC complex than the other? In addition, O’Brien et al. (2018) seem to suggest that both the mature and star miRNA molecules could play some role in gene expression – does that mean we should be considering both to be important?\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nO’Brien, Jacob, Heyam Hayder, Yara Zayed, and Chun Peng. 2018. “Overview of MicroRNA Biogenesis, Mechanisms of Actions, and Circulation.” Frontiers in Endocrinology 9 (August): 402. https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2018.00402.\n\n\nTomari, Yukihide, and Phillip D.

I liked a lot of things about the narration itself. Some of the voice options were very human-like and easy to listen to, and it did a pretty good (though not perfect) job of pronouncing uncommon jargon. On the other hand, I disliked several aspects of how it displays the content you’ve uploaded while it’s narrating it. Upon uploading a pdf, all of the text is extracted and displayed in a sectioned viewing pane that is completely removed from the original pdf (see below). That means that, in order to refer to figures or find “where” what you’re listening to is in the original document , you have to navigate to a completely separate pane to view the original pdf. Audemic also doesn’t track in-text where the reader is at that time, so it’s very difficult to find where you are in the text. Finally, there are a couple annoying things, like buggy Zotero uploading and being unable to switch “voice” without re-uploading the document.\nOverall, given the many features I find annoying and the still-high price tag, I’m not sure Audemic is worth the money, but it is the most human-like option I’ve found so far."

Objectively though, it does seem like a decent option.\nThe real strengths of Voice Dream seem to lie in its customizable text navigation features. For example, you can choose your forward and backward “skip” buttons to skip by different time intervals, by paragraph, by heading, etc. You can set a timer for how long the narration will read, and can change a variety of visual settings (font, spacing, background color, etc.). When reading you can choose to view the text in either a plain text viewing pane or in the original document and both options support an in-text speech cursor to show where the narration is.\nHowever, several of the boasted features fell flat to me. While there are a ton of voices to choose from, all of the ones I tried are much more synth-sounding than Audemic, in both tone and inflection. Pronunciation of jargon is also not as good as Audemic, though there does seem to be a feature for correcting pronunciation of individual words. As in Audemic, your voice selection is document-specific, so you have to re-select the voice you want every time. While the website claims Voice Dream skips citations and superfluous text, when I uploaded a pdf and tried listening it didn’t skip either of these. It also didn’t identify sections for my uploaded pdf (e.g. Abstract, Intro, etc.), so I couldn’t use the section navigation option. On top of these disappointing features, some features are missing entirely. Voice Dream has no web app, so you can’t listen from a PC or Android, and there’s no option to import directly from Zotero or PaperPile, meaning manual upload is required.\nUltimately I know the quality of the voice is going to be much more important for my retention than text navigation features, so I don’t think Voice Dream is a good option for me. The voices are just too robotic, especially in comparison with Audemic."

It’s very expensive, and the price was increased in the last month from an already high $120/yr to a staggering $140/yr. After trying it out, though, I think this may be my favorite option!\nSpeechify has all of the standard text navigation/viewing options (in-text tracker, can view original document or transcribed reading pane with viewing features, adjustable reading speed, skip citations+, etc.), but there are two features that really stand out to me. The first is that a lot of the voices are very lifelike and easy for me to listen to, which is really important to me. The second is their ambient sound option, which allows you to play background sound (e.g. music on Spotify, white noise) at an automatically lowered volume while the app narrates text on top. This is super cool for me! I’ve been looking for something like this for a really long time, because when I work out I want to play music with a suitable beat, but I also want to listen to audiobooks or something because I get bored quickly – that’s exactly what this feature does! The last cool feature that also deserves a mention is Speechify’s AI integration. You can generate AI summaries of any document, and you can ask questions to chatGPT in the speechify app and then listen to the responses.\nMost of my annoyances with Speechify are pretty minor. Like most of the other options, Speechify doesn’t have a way to upload documents directly from Zotero (or any other reference manager), which makes the process more tedious. There’s also no feature to separate text into navigable sections (e.g. Intro, Methods), and you can’t annotate in-app, so you’d need to switch to a different tool to make notes, highlight, etc."

Bedtools states in the documentation for it’s getfasta function that gff files are accepted as input, but it isn’t made clear whether bedtools will treat the genomic coordinates in a gff file as 1-based, or as the o-based system used in bedtool’s more standard file format, bed.\nTo test whether bedtools can appropriately identify and parse both gff and bed files, I wrote some quick test files to run through bedtools getfasta.\nWrite the test files:\n\n\necho -e \"&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\" &gt; test_input.fasta\necho -e \"AAAGGGTTTCCCAAAGGGTTTCCC\" &gt;&gt; test_input.fasta\n\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t1\\t5\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt; test_input.gff\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t11\\t15\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt;&gt; test_input.gff\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t20\\t20\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000002\" &gt;&gt; test_input.gff\n\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t0\\t5\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt; test_input.bed\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t10\\t15\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt;&gt; test_input.bed\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t19\\t20\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000002\" &gt;&gt; test_input.bed\n\nexport PATH=/home/shared/bedops_linux_x86_64-v2.4.41/bin:$PATH\n\n${bedops}/gff2bed --do-not-sort &lt; test_input.gff &gt; test_input_gfftobed.bed\n\nRun through bedtools getfasta:\n\nsource .bashvars\ncd ~/deep-dive/E-Peve/data\n\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input.gff -fo test_gff_to_fasta.fasta\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input.bed -fo test_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input_gfftobed.bed -fo test_gff_to_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n\nhead test_gff_to_fasta.fasta\necho \"\"\nhead test_bed_to_fasta.fasta\necho \"\"\nhead test_gff_to_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n\nOutput:\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T  \n\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T  \n\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T\nAll three files resulted in identical FASTA outputs !

You can use collapse=\"true\" to collapse it by default or collapse=\"false\" to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n\n\n\nYou can also adjust the appearance of callouts in your doc\n\n\nCode annotation\nYou can insert footnote-like in-code anotations. This seems potentially redundant if you have good commenting in your code but it could still help make code explanations more digestible. You can also adjust how the annotation will appear using the code-annotations: command in the document YAML.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n1penguins |&gt;\n2  mutate(\n    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm,\n    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm\n  )\n\n1\n\nTake penguins, and then,\n\n2\n\nadd new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor tools\nThere are a whooooolllllleeee bunch of different options for specifying different author/article information that’s normally included in scientific publications (authors, affiliations, corresponding, copyright, orcid ID, abstract, keywords, etc.).

    "section": "",
    "text": "We (Eric, Grace L., Ariana, and I) spent the day at the Point Whitney research station, performing a reciprocal heat stress treatment and sampling on 4 Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) life stages (spat, seed, juvenile, adult) for Eric’s thesis work. See previous post for materials and Ariana’s post for project details.\nOrganism: Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)\nLifestages: Seed, Spat, Juvenile, Adult\nFor each of the four life stages, Eric had already performed an original conditioning treatment. We an additiol reciprocal exposure to acute stress. For example, half of the spat “control” group was exposed to the 32*C “high” stress, half of the “control” group was left in ambient temperature, half of the “treated” spat group was exposed to the 32*C “high” stress, and half of the “treated” spat group was left in ambient.\nConditioning treatment groups: Control, Treated\nAcute stress treatment groups: Ambient, High (32*C)\nPossible treatment group combinations: Control/Ambient, Control/High, Treated/Ambient, Treated/High\nFor each age class, each set of treatment conditions was sampled. Sampling was performed slightly differently for each age, due to size restrictions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge class\nSampling approach (for each of the 4 treatment combinations)\n\n\n\n\nSpat\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Whole animals were preserved, since the spat are too small to easily extract tissue from the shell.\n\n\nSeed\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Seed are larger than spat, so we were able to crack open the shell of each animal and preserve the whole animal tissue.\n\n\nJuvenile\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Juveniles are large enough to open the shell and differentiate between tissue types, but too small to split gill tissue into multiple samples, so the entire gill tissue of each animal was sampled.\n\n\nAdult\nOverview: 24 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=8, DNA n=8, frozen n=8) from 8 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 8 animals total. From each animal, gill tissue was extracted and separated into three portions, which were preserved for RNA, DNA, and flash frozen. This means we have “sets” of samples for the adults (e.g. a sample preserved for RNA work is associated with a sample preserved for DNA and a sample that was flash frozen, since all three are from the same animal), with a total of 24 samples for each treatment combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl/Ambient\nControl/High\nTreated/Ambient\nTreated/High\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nSpat\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nSeed\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nJuvenile\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nAdult\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 32\nDNA: 32\nfrozen: 32\n96 total\n\n\nTotal\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 104\nDNA: 104\nfrozen: 92\n300 total samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe oysters (each age class and treatment group in individual tubes or bags)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA juvenile oyster during sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOysters post-sampling"

Research activities using animal models of disease, for developing or testing of drugs or other procedures for treatment of disease or disorder are not eligible.\n(ii) Research focused on basic questions in plant pathology are eligible, however, applied studies focused on maximizing production in agricultural plants or impacts on food safety, are not eligible.\n(iii) Research with implications that inform policy is eligible. Research with the expressed intent to influence, advocate for, or effect specific policy outcomes is not eligible.\nd) Limited exceptions to ineligible proposed research\n(i) Certain areas of bioengineering research directed at medical use are eligible. These include research projects in bioengineering to aid persons with disabilities, or to diagnose or treat human disease or disorder, provided they apply engineering principles to problems in medicine while primarily advancing engineering knowledge. Applicants planning to study and conduct research in these areas of bioengineering should select biomedical engineering as the field of study.\n(ii) Certain areas of materials research directed at development of materials for use in biological or biomedical systems are eligible, provided they are focused on furthering fundamental materials research.\n(iii) Certain areas of research with etiology-, diagnosis-, or treatment-related goals that advance fundamental knowledge in engineering, mathematical, physical, computer or information sciences, are eligible for support.\nAquaculture and other forms of animal farming is not specifically mentioned, but the emphasis seems to be that research should be intended to advance fundamental knowledge. Since aquaculture is inherently applied, it’s probably best to steer clear in the proposal."

Aka take an oyster after hardening and see how long it survives at 35C, monitoring heartbeat and stuff.

Would be important during priming stage.\nIn hatchery settings:\n\n“In the Pacific Northwest, the Pacific oyster may be induced to spawn and viable gametes may be obtained at any time during the year. Year-round spawning is possible because the Pacific oyster normally does not completely spawn out in all Pacific Northwest estuarine areas, generally too cool to induce complete spawning.”\nConditioning: Oyster with sufficient glycogen stores held at 18-20C for 4 weeks to develop mature gametes. These conditioned oysters will be prime for induced spawning for the next 2-4 weeks.\nInitiating spawning: Raise water to 25C, then to 30C over 30min period. Then fluctuate between 25C and 30C. Addition of gametes to the water can also induce spawning, presumably because of some hormone signaling.\n(Breese and Malouf 1975)\n\nIn natural/outplant conditions:\n\nIn France’s Thau Lagoon, which is characterized by no tidal amplitude (oysters remain submerged), high summer temps and salinities (&gt;26C and 36 PSU), low phytoplankton concentration, and high oyster growth rates.\n“gametogenesis intensity (GSI, fecundity) was correlated to the abundance of diatoms”\n“spawning in C. gigas does not occur below a daily seawater temperature of 17-18°C”, but also noted that mass spawning in the warm Thau Lagoon occurred at a much higher temp of 22C, likely because of the water’s higher average temperature and/or the absence of a tide cycle that would expose the oysters to dessication or aerial temperature stress. So there’s some room for thermal acclimatization/adaptation in the spawning trigger!\nOther possible spawning triggers include phytoplankton concentration, lunar cycle, and presence of thunder storms.\n(Ubertini et al. 2017)\n\nExperimental testing:\n\nExperimental testing of environmental conditions impact on gametogenisis (gonadal development/broodstock conditioning)\nFastest gonadal development (oocyte maturation) at 22C (first mature oocytes in 19 days)\n\n(Chávez-Villalba et al. 2002)\n\nSummary: Generally speaking, gametogenisis is prompted by a minimum temperature of 17C - 18C in the presence of sufficient energy storage. Fastest maturation happens around 22C, with spawning triggered by warmer temperatures than used during conditioning (e.g., 25C to 30C). If we’re acclimatizing in the 25C range there will likely be resultant gametogenisis, but conditioning for ~2 weeks is sufficiently short to prevent full gonadal maturation (“ripening”) and subsequent spawning. Not entirely clear though what happens if you hold at 20C for 2 weeks and then drop back down in temp – would gametogenisis continue?\n\n\nHardening timeline\nShould look at all the hardening papers to try to assess best timeline (e.g. how long to harden, how long to wait between hardening and stress)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAge\nSource\nHardening regime\nOutcome\nPaper\n\n\n\n\nManila clam (R. philippinarum)\nadult\nwild caught\n28C or 30C for 2 hrs, recover for 12 hrs, stress test of 30C or 32C 1wk\n30C hardening improved survival at 30C stress\n(Zhang, Nie, and Yan 2023)\n\n\nOlympia oyster (O. lurida)\njuvenile\nhatchery\n15C or 21C 2wks, plus tide treatment (submerged & exposed for 6hr each, 2x/day).

Then hardened at 28C or 30C for 2 hours, then left to recover at 18C for 12 hours. Then subjected to extreme stress test (increase 2C/hr), either 30C or 32C for one week. Found that 30C hardening significantly improved survival time at 30C stress, but 28C did not (in comparison to non-hardened). Also, hardening made no difference at the 32C stress test. Maybe this means that it’s best to harden at temperature of stress test (i.e. harden at temperature expected to experience in MHW conditions)?\n(Shukla 2023):\nJuvenile O. lurida, juvenile C. sikamea, and juvenile C. gigas from hatchery. Acclimated at 15C, treatment groups hardened at 21C (0.5C/hr) for 2 weeks. In both control and temperature treatment, also included a tide treatment, in which oysters were intermittently submerged and exposed for 6hr each, twice a day. After hardening, recovered at immerged at 15C for 24hr. MHW treatments (reached at 0.5C/hr) were 15C, 18C, 1C, and 24C, no tidal component, for 72hr. Surviving O. lurida were outplanted in Sacramento for 9 months (March 2022 - Dec. 2022).\nVery little mortality (&lt;10%) in all species/treatments during hardening/MHW test, and no significant effect of temp or tidal hardening on MHW survival. In O. lurida and C. sikamea, temp hardening had a negative impact on growth (i.e. 15C control was largest). However, in C. gigas, temp hardening had no effect on growth and tidal hardening improved growth. In outplanting, all O. lurida with tidal hardening died, but those hardened at 21C (fully submerged) had much higher survival than control (15C submerged).\n(Moyen et al. 2020):\nAdult, wild-caught M. californianus hardened at 25C, 30C, or 35C for 2hr, then recovered at 14C for 1-28 days, then underwent stress test at 40C for 2hr. Following stress test, back in 14C and monitered for 4 weeks. 30C hardening conferred improved heat tolerance for 14 days, and the 35C hardening improved survival for 21 days after extreme stress, but effect gone by day 28.\nThis experimental design has a great component of waiting 4 weeks after extreme stress to evaluate mortality. I really like this idea, since stress could kill after the actual event is over. Also, test temperatures selected because 25C was lowest temp at which HSPs are upregulated in species, 35C is ~1C below species’ critical temperature of cardiac function, and 40C is avg lethal temp in species. Also has a cool graph of # days between heat stress bouts.\n“Heat hardening has typically been defined as a transient response that confers improved heat tolerance immediately after the initial heat-stress bout for up to 32 h [9,12,13,39,40], while longer-lasting improvements in heat tolerance are termed as heat acclimation.”\n(Scanes et al. 2023):\nAustralian adult, hatchery-reared S. glomerata acclimated for 1 week at 23C. Two emmersion heat treatments, 30C and 40C. First hardening 1.5hr, back to ambient 1 wk, then three more hardening treatments of 2 hrs each, separated by 1 wk each time (total of 4 hardening treatments over 4 weeks). Simulated MHW 1wk after final hardening, kept at emmersed 50C for 2hr. Monitered for 48 hr, then checked at day 8 and 16. Also note there’s an antibiotic group, since study investigates pathogen load.\n40C hardening improved survival and growth, but 30C did not. Also, control+antibiotic oysters had improved survival. Suggests hardening may be bolstering capacity to repel pathogenic bacteria as one mechanism of improving post-HW survival.\n(He et al. 2021):\nAdult, wild-caught P. maxima oysters acclimated at 24C for 1 day, then exposed to MHW conditions at 28C and 32C for 3 days, 3 days recovery, followed by another exposure and recovery. Note that 36C treatment also attempted but saw 100% mortality. Observed significant changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes, biomineralization-related enzymes, and energy-metabolizing enzymes. Note this isn’t actually a hardening experiment, it’s a repeat MHW exposure experiment. It’s energetics-focused though, so should probably read in more depth at some point.\n(Giomi et al. 2016):\nWild-caught tropical oyster I. nucleus, acclimated at 26C for 1month. Emmersed at 26C (control) and 40C for 4 hrs, then immersed again in 26C and 35C (reciprocal exposure setup, 4 treatment combos total). Temperature-induced mortality rate and 50% lethal temp then measured, plus respirometry and hsp70 mRNA expression. Thermal tolerance, lethal temperature threshold, and oxygen consumption rates significantly improved in heat-stressed group (40C-26c and 40C-35C), and hsp70 expression increased. Interestingly though, feeding rates following stress were much lower in the heat-stressed groups.\nSimilar resilience evaluation approach to what we’re thinking in own project (quantifying temperature induced mortality and 50% lethal temp as a biomarker)\n\nMHW definition is pretty distinct, would need to decide what type of scenario to simulate\nNeed to figure out sample sizes for whatever tests I want to do. Would be benefited by running some test assays before starting experiment. A bunch of these assays have been used with Pacific oysters already, so could find those and make a table or something. \nApparently heartbeat is potentially a better metric for metabolic rate than respiration, and is nondestructive\nShould also keep in mind that genetic composition can completely change the true sample size (e.g., if triploids and diploids are siblings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBreese, Wilbur P, and Robert E Malouf. 1975. “Hatchery Manual for the Pacific Oyster.” Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program Agricultural Experiment Station (443). https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/db78td066.\n\n\nChávez-Villalba, Jorge, Julien Pommier, Jimmy Andriamiseza, Stéphane Pouvreau, Jean Barret, Jean-Claude Cochard, and Marcel Le Pennec. 2002. “Broodstock Conditioning of the Oyster Crassostrea Gigas: Origin and Temperature Effect.” Aquaculture 214 (1): 115–30. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(01)00898-5.\n\n\nGiomi, Folco, Concetta Mandaglio, Monthon Ganmanee, Guo-Dong Han, Yun-Wei Dong, Gray A.

    "text": "Trial run of extreme stress test using the extra untreated, diploid “13” oysters currently stored in seawater cold room in FTR.\n\n\n\nPlan\nPlace oysters in 43C seawater for 1hr, then remove and return to ambient. Check daily for mortality for ~2wks.\n\n\nTrial protocol\n\nFilled a clean tripour container with 700 mL of seawater from the cold seawater tank in FTR. Placed in the incubator at 42C at roughly 13:00 7/11/2024.\nIsolated two groups of 10 oysters from bag “13” (untreated diploid), selecting similarly sized sets of oysters. Placed the two groups into small mesh bags, then placed back in the cold seawater tank (~10C) in FTR. Selected and grouped oysters at roughly 15:00 7/11/2024.\nNote: …at 17:30 the seawater still isn’t at 43C. Incubator is now empty so setting the incubator to 44C, covered the tripour with plastic wrap to prevent evaporation, and leaving it to finish preheating overnight. Will hopefully be able to finish this stress tomorrow.\nRandomly assigned one bag to treatment and one to control. Labelled each with a labelled 15mL tube placed inside bag and a colored zip tie attached to the bag (didn’t have any waterproof bag tags). Red is 43C group and blue is control. Measured length of each oyster in each group using a caliper, then placed back in respective labelled bags. Roughly 11:30 7/12/2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaced control oysters in tripour containing 700mL seawater from FTR tank, ambient temperature (13C). Left on table in cold room for 1 hr (11:47 - 12:47 7/12/2024), then placed oysters back into FTR tank.\n\n\nPlaced treatment oysters in tripour of warm seawater (~25C) for 10 seconds, then placed in tipour of 700mL seawater heated to 43C. Left in incubator set to 43.5C for 1 hr (11:51 - 12:53 7/12/2024). After 1 hr, removed and placed back into FTR tank.\n\nI dipped the treatment oysters into warmed water before treatment because I was worried about them bringing down the treatment temperature when added. Unfortunately, this attempt didn’t do enough to prevent the treatment water cooling, because at the end of the 1 hr treatment the water was only ~38C, despite being held in the heated incubator the whole time.\n\nCheck oysters in both groups for mortality once per day at roughly noon for the next 2 weeks. To check mortality, remove bag of oysters from tank, empty bag onto table. An empty shell or gaping with no response to stimulation (prodding with metal tool) indicates mortality.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBig takeaway is that I need to rethink the heating mechanism. It took a whole day for 700mL of water to be heated from 13C to 43C in the incubator, and the incubator is also unable to keep the water at correct temperature after adding oysters. Part of this problem could be solved by having two tripours heated all the way to 43C and using one to “preheat” the oysters before completing the full treatment in the second cup, but I still think we’d end up with the same problem of not staying at 43.\n\nThe rod heaters used at PW seem much faster and capable of maintaining a steady temp, but they also have to be used with a greater water volume. Maybe the stress test should be done in a bucket of heated seawater? Should only take a 2-3 hrs to heat bucket to 43 with one of those rods, the larger water volume means temp would be way less reduced by addition of oysters, and the rod heater would more quickly bring the water back up to 43 if needed.\nAs for this current stress test trial, I’m not really sure what to do about this. If the oysters were only in 35-38C water for the entire hour then it was more like the hardening treatmetnt and I’d guess won’t be very lethal. I think I’ll check mortality daily through the weekend, and if there’s no significant mortality in either group by Monday I’ll retry the stress test.\n\n\nMortality\nChecked bags daily at roughly noon for mortality. Mortality evaluated by prodding oysters and squeezing lightly at base of hinge. Empty shells or oysters that gaped and remained open during stimulation were considered dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTime\nControl (mm length of dead oyster(s))\nExtreme stress (mm length of dead oyster(s))\n\n\n\n\n7/13\n13:00\n-\n-\n\n\n7/14\n11:15\n-\n-\n\n\n7/15\n12:00\n30\n29, 30\n\n\n\nNotes: First mortalities on 7/15 (3 days after stress) in the smallest oysters, but see mortalities in both stress and control groups."

Oysters going into the 42C treatment were swirled in the 42C seawater for ~30sec before adding to 42C Resazurin, to minimize temperature change upon addition. Place 42C containers in incubator set to 42C, to maintain temperature throughout test.\nLeft oysters in treatment for 4 hours, sampling and measuring Resazurin every ~20min.\nAfter survivorship test concluded, rinsed all oyster groups in ambient seawater to remove residual Resazurin and placed in 8 separate, labelled mesh bags. Placed back in 20C seawater tank in FTR 208.\nAfter 1 hr checked all bags for mortality, and continued to check once a day for 1wk.\n\nResazurin data\nMortality data"
