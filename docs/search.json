Ultimately my first priority is DNa quantity, since short reads can still be read by the Nanopore pores, so I think my best option is to use a 0.7X bead-to-sample ratio for all samples during KAPA Pure Bead cleanup."

    "text": "Meeting with Andrea Quattrini, advisor for SIFP, and Dan MacGuigan, collaborator who has worked a lot with Nanopore sequencing (MinION and PromethION)\n\nMajor Questions:\nDealing w fungal contamination?\nAdaptive sampling?\nHow many samples can we multiplex?\nLigation vs rapid sequencing?\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSmithsonian has a MinION!\nflow cells have pretty short shelf life, so even if other Smithsonian folks have leftover reagents, will likely need to order new\nwill need a reference genome, both for downstream analyses and for adaptive sampling\n\ncould also use a de novo genome from sequencing the recent samples\nwith very fresh tissue, since the genome is p small, could get close to chromosome level genome assembly with nanopore. Andrea notes though that they’ve had a lot of trouble with assembling coral genomes, possibly due to weird genome architecture.\nSo maybe genome assembly could be a bonus if the species we use ends up being straightforward to assemble, but for now we should try to find samples that at least fall in same genus as a published genome. Will be trickier if we’re using octocorals (for the better sequencing)\nAndrea will look at the collections and available octocoral genomes to see if there’s a good candidate.\n\nadaptive sampling could help reduce sequencing of contaminants, but might be less useful with degraded dna (short reads can end up being fully sequenced before pores have a chance to kick them out)\nWill ideally want 20x - 30x coverage for methylation calls. Can probably look into what coverage v depth we want for methylation calling\nMinION flowcell specs: https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/flow-cell-r10-4-1-2025.html\ncould try a test run with minion flongle: https://nanoporetech.com/products/sequence/flongle\nlook/ask around about accessing a promethion.\nWith the wash kits you don’t actually run the while library each time, you split it up. SO using wash doesn’t require more library.\nWill need to check seq length/molarity (Smithsonian has the tools for this)\nExpect fragmentation to be an issue. In Andrea’s experience, coral hDNA fragments are max ~1000bp. Should look into how fragmentation could/will affect methylation calling. Could think about a size selection? Should ask folks in meeting next week about their experience\nmake a list of things Andrea needs to buy.\n\n\n\nMy to-dos:\n\nLook more into what coverage v depth we want for methylation calling\nLook into how use of fragmented DNA can affect methylation calling, including any differences between MinION and PromethION\nLooks into accessing a PromethION sequencer at a nearby facility\n\nJohns Hopkins (Baltimore, MD) has a PromethION, but I can’t find additional details for requesting use right now, because the webpage for their Genetic Resources Core Facility is down\nNIH Center for Cancer Research (Bethesda, MD) is close , but it looks like they only allow NIH employees/affiliates to use their sequencing facilities. I’d also guess they’re in a lot of tummult right now\nUW has a Nanopore Sequencing Core which uses a PromethION. Note sure if I can request a quote from them without sample details (e.g. extraction method, dna concentration), but they have a table of cost estimates here.\nIf I’m understanding the “services” correctly, it looks like it’s $1,210/flow cell and ~$40/sample for Barcoding with Rapid Prep libraries. I may also be cheaper if we want to multiplex 4 or more samples on a single flow cell.\nSo say we wanted to do 12 samples, multiplex w 4 samples per flow cell: 1210*(3 flow cells) + 40*(12 samples) = $4,110\nOptimistically I think we could do it on just two PromethION flow cells: 1210*2+40*12 = $2,900"

    "text": "I’m meeting with Andrea tomorrow to discuss the SIFP project, so I spent some time researching the Nanopore direct sequencing workflow and associated costs.\n\nMultiplexing:\nPromethION and MionION platforms support multiplexing, where DNA is tagged with sample-specific barcodes during library prep, allowing multiple samples to be run simultaneously on a single flow cell. Since flow cells are the most expensive component of nanopore sequencing by far, multiplexing could dramatically reduce the sequencing cost per sample.\nAccording to Rubi, Knowles, and Dantzer (2020), while recommended minimum read depth for methylation analysis is 10X, their hDNA samples showed little difference in # of CpG positions for a minimum read depth of 5X and 10X. So our goal should be a minimum of 10X depth, but lower could be acceptable?\nDeng et al. (2024) used a PromethION for WGS of the human genome and multiplexed 3 samples per cell, incorporating a cell wash to improve performance, and generated 154 Gb of output with a final mean read depth of 12X. This tracks with ONT’s specifications of 100-200 Gb output gDNA reads from a PromethION flow cell. NOTE though that the human genome is *much* larger than a coral genome. \nIf we assume an output of 150 Gb (150,000 Mb), how many samples could be multiplexed while maintaining minimum read depth?\n\nHuman genome: 3,000 Mb\n10X read depth: 30,000 Mb\nSequencing output: 150,000 Mb\nMultiplexing max = 5 samples/flow cell\nCoral genome: 500 Mb\n10X read depth: 5,000 Mb\nSequencing output: 150,000 Mb\nMultiplexing max = 30 samples/flow cell\n\nSay we want 3 time points (e.g., 100yo, 50yo, &lt;20yo). Probably need a minimum of n=5 for each, so minimum of N=15.\nI think we’d easily be able to run all 15 samples on a single flow cell! Since flow cells are only sold in packs of 4, we’ll also end up with extra to do more sequencing if desired/possible. \n\n\nChoosing library prep\n\nRapid (ligation-free) library prep kit seems best. Of the methylation-friendly options, it requires the least input DNA (still kind of high though? 100ng?). It also has barcode options to support multiplexing!\n\n\nCost estimate:\nAssuming minimum N=15 on a PromethION, incorporating multiplexing to reduce cost/sample.\n\n\n\nItem\n# rxns/unit\nPrice ($/unit)\n# units\nTotal cost\n\n\nRapid Barcoding Kit 96 V14\n96\n1100\n1\n1100\n\n\nPromethION Flow Cell Packs (R10.4.1)\n1 pack: 4 cells\n3980\n1\n3980\n\n\nFlow Cell Wash Kit\n6\n115\n1\n115\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5,195\n\n\n\nSo estimated cost of library prep and sequencing for N=15 samples on a PromethION sequencing platform is $5,195. Note that this could be reduced by a few hundred dollars by buying a 24-reaction library prep kit, but it’s dramatically more cost effective to buy the 96-reaction kit. That also gives us plenty of wiggle room for unsuccessful library prep or sequencing.\nNote that this doesn’t take DNA extraction and QC into account. I’ll need to talk to Andrea about this portion since the LAB has some community-available resources and the number of samples I’ll extract/QC will be strongly influenced by extraction success.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDeng, Wayne Xianding, Monika Sun, Pauline Ng, Premal Shah, Kate Im, and Akash Kumar. 2024. “P646: Development of an Affordable Rapid Human Genome Sequencing Assay Using Long Read PromethiON 2.” Genetics in Medicine Open 2: 101552. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gimo.2024.101552.\n\n\nRubi, Tricia L., L.

    "text": "As a reminder, this project involved hardening adult diploid and triploid Pacific oysters with a regular thermal stress treatment (35C for 4hrs, 2x a week, for 2 weeks), then performing two consecutive survivorship trials. See details in other posts in this project directory.\nSince the second survivorship trial I have kept all surviving oysters in their individual containers on benchtop in a standard lab room (maintained at 18-20C). I changed the water in each cup regularly, maintaing a roughly 1:6 ratio of oyster: water volume. Water used was dechlorinated tap water mixed with Instant Ocean to ~25psu salinity. Notably, no algae or either food has been added during water changes – the oysters were last fed just before Survivorship Round 2 (August 9 2024). For the first few weeks I changed the water every 1-2 days. Once I felt sure that latent effect of the survivorship trial had presented themselves I began extending the time between water changes to ~1 week. I noticed little change in mortality following the increased time between water changes, so I’m assuming there is sufficient ambient air-water exchange to prevent asphyxiation between changes.\nGeneral observations (see details in pictures and paper lab notebook):"

The original hardening was done at 35C, while survivorship round 1 was at 42C, the same temperature the oysters then experienced during this survivorship round. My brief review of other papers that attempted hardening in bivalves did suggest that hardening was most effective when conditions were similar to those the organism would experience during an extreme stress event post-hardening"

Check daily for mortality for ~2wks.\n\n\nTrial protocol\n\nFilled a clean tripour container with 700 mL of seawater from the cold seawater tank in FTR. Placed in the incubator at 42C at roughly 13:00 7/11/2024.\nIsolated two groups of 10 oysters from bag “13” (untreated diploid), selecting similarly sized sets of oysters. Placed the two groups into small mesh bags, then placed back in the cold seawater tank (~10C) in FTR. Selected and grouped oysters at roughly 15:00 7/11/2024.\nNote: …at 17:30 the seawater still isn’t at 43C. Incubator is now empty so setting the incubator to 44C, covered the tripour with plastic wrap to prevent evaporation, and leaving it to finish preheating overnight. Will hopefully be able to finish this stress tomorrow.\nRandomly assigned one bag to treatment and one to control. Labelled each with a labelled 15mL tube placed inside bag and a colored zip tie attached to the bag (didn’t have any waterproof bag tags). Red is 43C group and blue is control. Measured length of each oyster in each group using a caliper, then placed back in respective labelled bags. Roughly 11:30 7/12/2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaced control oysters in tripour containing 700mL seawater from FTR tank, ambient temperature (13C). Left on table in cold room for 1 hr (11:47 - 12:47 7/12/2024), then placed oysters back into FTR tank.\n\n\nPlaced treatment oysters in tripour of warm seawater (~25C) for 10 seconds, then placed in tipour of 700mL seawater heated to 43C. Left in incubator set to 43.5C for 1 hr (11:51 - 12:53 7/12/2024). After 1 hr, removed and placed back into FTR tank.\n\nI dipped the treatment oysters into warmed water before treatment because I was worried about them bringing down the treatment temperature when added. Unfortunately, this attempt didn’t do enough to prevent the treatment water cooling, because at the end of the 1 hr treatment the water was only ~38C, despite being held in the heated incubator the whole time.\n\nCheck oysters in both groups for mortality once per day at roughly noon for the next 2 weeks. To check mortality, remove bag of oysters from tank, empty bag onto table. An empty shell or gaping with no response to stimulation (prodding with metal tool) indicates mortality.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBig takeaway is that I need to rethink the heating mechanism. It took a whole day for 700mL of water to be heated from 13C to 43C in the incubator, and the incubator is also unable to keep the water at correct temperature after adding oysters. Part of this problem could be solved by having two tripours heated all the way to 43C and using one to “preheat” the oysters before completing the full treatment in the second cup, but I still think we’d end up with the same problem of not staying at 43.\n\nThe rod heaters used at PW seem much faster and capable of maintaining a steady temp, but they also have to be used with a greater water volume. Maybe the stress test should be done in a bucket of heated seawater? Should only take a 2-3 hrs to heat bucket to 43 with one of those rods, the larger water volume means temp would be way less reduced by addition of oysters, and the rod heater would more quickly bring the water back up to 43 if needed.\nAs for this current stress test trial, I’m not really sure what to do about this. If the oysters were only in 35-38C water for the entire hour then it was more like the hardening treatmetnt and I’d guess won’t be very lethal. I think I’ll check mortality daily through the weekend, and if there’s no significant mortality in either group by Monday I’ll retry the stress test.\n\n\nMortality\nChecked bags daily at roughly noon for mortality. Mortality evaluated by prodding oysters and squeezing lightly at base of hinge. Empty shells or oysters that gaped and remained open during stimulation were considered dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTime\nControl (mm length of dead oyster(s))\nExtreme stress (mm length of dead oyster(s))\n\n\n\n\n7/13\n13:00\n-\n-\n\n\n7/14\n11:15\n-\n-\n\n\n7/15\n12:00\n30\n29, 30\n\n\n\nNotes: First mortalities on 7/15 (3 days after stress) in the smallest oysters, but see mortalities in both stress and control groups."

I had to cut the 4hr treatment a few minutes short to make my ferry and return the Ucar on time. To budget extra heating time I modified my Wednesday and Friday Ucar reservations to check out an hour earlier.\nI took probe measurements from the three holer and dock, and from each of the stress treatment containers.

Also noticed that the fluorometer is not perfectly accurate (e.g., reading increased at one point, which I don’t think should be possible).\n\n\nTrial 2\n\nOne untreated, diploid oyster (“13” cohort); One untreated, triploid oyster (“Bird” cohort); Once control cup with no oyster\nPlaced each oyster in 700ml dilution of algae-rich seawater (100ml algal water from black tub, 600 mL of seawater).

Not sure if that would affect chlorophyll levels though…\nThe diploid “13” oyster didn’t seem to consume any algae. I noticed during the trial that oyster looked fully closed during most of the trial, while the “Bird” oyster was clearly opened. If we want to use clearance rate experimentally, we’d need to have a backup plan for oysters that don’t want to feed.\n\n\n\n\n“Bird” oysters (right) much more open than “13” oyster (left)\n\n\nI also noticed after the trial that the “Bird” oyster I was using actually had a second, smaller oyster fused to it (see below), which may have affected the rate of decrease.\n\n\n\nsmall second oyster attached to Trial 2 “Bird” oyster\n\n\n\n\n\nNotebook photos\nSee notes from the day and original probe measurements and clearance rate trial data below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUcar/ferry receipts"

    "text": "Addressing some questions/notes raised during preliminary project planning\n\nGametogenisis/spawning conditions\nWe’d need to make sure they don’t spawn, so need to do some digging into what conditions might induce spawning. Would be important during priming stage.\nIn hatchery settings:\n\n“In the Pacific Northwest, the Pacific oyster may be induced to spawn and viable gametes may be obtained at any time during the year. Year-round spawning is possible because the Pacific oyster normally does not completely spawn out in all Pacific Northwest estuarine areas, generally too cool to induce complete spawning.”\nConditioning: Oyster with sufficient glycogen stores held at 18-20C for 4 weeks to develop mature gametes. These conditioned oysters will be prime for induced spawning for the next 2-4 weeks.\nInitiating spawning: Raise water to 25C, then to 30C over 30min period. Then fluctuate between 25C and 30C. Addition of gametes to the water can also induce spawning, presumably because of some hormone signaling.\n(Breese and Malouf 1975)\n\nIn natural/outplant conditions:\n\nIn France’s Thau Lagoon, which is characterized by no tidal amplitude (oysters remain submerged), high summer temps and salinities (&gt;26C and 36 PSU), low phytoplankton concentration, and high oyster growth rates.\n“gametogenesis intensity (GSI, fecundity) was correlated to the abundance of diatoms”\n“spawning in C. gigas does not occur below a daily seawater temperature of 17-18°C”, but also noted that mass spawning in the warm Thau Lagoon occurred at a much higher temp of 22C, likely because of the water’s higher average temperature and/or the absence of a tide cycle that would expose the oysters to dessication or aerial temperature stress. So there’s some room for thermal acclimatization/adaptation in the spawning trigger!\nOther possible spawning triggers include phytoplankton concentration, lunar cycle, and presence of thunder storms.\n(Ubertini et al. 2017)\n\nExperimental testing:\n\nExperimental testing of environmental conditions impact on gametogenisis (gonadal development/broodstock conditioning)\nFastest gonadal development (oocyte maturation) at 22C (first mature oocytes in 19 days)\n\n(Chávez-Villalba et al. 2002)\n\nSummary: Generally speaking, gametogenisis is prompted by a minimum temperature of 17C - 18C in the presence of sufficient energy storage. Fastest maturation happens around 22C, with spawning triggered by warmer temperatures than used during conditioning (e.g., 25C to 30C). If we’re acclimatizing in the 25C range there will likely be resultant gametogenisis, but conditioning for ~2 weeks is sufficiently short to prevent full gonadal maturation (“ripening”) and subsequent spawning. Not entirely clear though what happens if you hold at 20C for 2 weeks and then drop back down in temp – would gametogenisis continue?\n\n\nHardening timeline\nShould look at all the hardening papers to try to assess best timeline (e.g. how long to harden, how long to wait between hardening and stress)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAge\nSource\nHardening regime\nOutcome\nPaper\n\n\n\n\nManila clam (R. philippinarum)\nadult\nwild caught\n28C or 30C for 2 hrs, recover for 12 hrs, stress test of 30C or 32C 1wk\n30C hardening improved survival at 30C stress\n(Zhang, Nie, and Yan 2023)\n\n\nOlympia oyster (O. lurida)\njuvenile\nhatchery\n15C or 21C 2wks, plus tide treatment (submerged & exposed for 6hr each, 2x/day). MHW 15C, 18C, 1C, and 24C for 72hr. Survivors outplanted 9months\nno effects on short-term mortality, but hardening improved outplanting survival. Temp hardening inhibited growth.\n(Shukla 2023)\n\n\nKumamoto oyster (C. sikamea)\njuvenile\nhatchery\n15C or 21C 2wks, plus tide treatment (submerged & exposed for 6hr each, 2x/day). MHW 15C, 18C, 1C, and 24C for 72hr.\nno effects on mortality, temp hardening inhibited growth\n(Shukla 2023)\n\n\nPacific oyster (C. gigas)\njuvenile\nhatchery\n15C or 21C 2wks, plus tide treatment (submerged & exposed for 6hr each, 2x/day). MHW 15C, 18C, 1C, and 24C for 72hr.\nno effects on mortality, tidal hardening improved growth.\n(Shukla 2023)\n\n\nCalifornia mussel (M. californianus)\nadult\nwild caught\nhardened at 25C, 30C, or 35C for 2hr, recovered at 14C for 1-28 days, then stress test 40C for 2hr\n30C and 35C improved survival for 2-3 weeks, but effect gone by day 28\n(Moyen et al. 2020)\n\n\nSydney rock oyster (S. glomerata)\nadult\nhatchery\nFour ~2hr emmersion hardening at 30C and 40C, each separated by 1wk, then MHW of emmersed at 50C for 2hr\n40C hardening improved survival and growth, as did control+antibiotics\n(Scanes et al. 2023)\n\n\nPearl oyster (P. maxima)\nadult\nwild caught\ntwo iterations of 28C or 32C for 3 days, with 3 day recovery for each\nChanges in enzyme activity for antioxidents, biomineralization, metabolism\n(He et al. 2021)\n\n\nspecies of tropical oyster (I. nucleus)\n\nwild caught\nreciprocal cross of air (26C and 40C, 4hrs) X water (26C and 35C, 4hrs)\nHardening increased thermal tolerance and lethal range, respiration, hsp70 expression\n(Giomi et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n(Zhang, Nie, and Yan 2023):\nWild-caught adult Manila clams acclimated at 13.5C for 1 week, increased by 1C per day to 18C, then maintained for 1 week. Then hardened at 28C or 30C for 2 hours, then left to recover at 18C for 12 hours. Then subjected to extreme stress test (increase 2C/hr), either 30C or 32C for one week. Found that 30C hardening significantly improved survival time at 30C stress, but 28C did not (in comparison to non-hardened). Also, hardening made no difference at the 32C stress test. Maybe this means that it’s best to harden at temperature of stress test (i.e. harden at temperature expected to experience in MHW conditions)?\n(Shukla 2023):\nJuvenile O. lurida, juvenile C. sikamea, and juvenile C. gigas from hatchery. Acclimated at 15C, treatment groups hardened at 21C (0.5C/hr) for 2 weeks. In both control and temperature treatment, also included a tide treatment, in which oysters were intermittently submerged and exposed for 6hr each, twice a day. After hardening, recovered at immerged at 15C for 24hr. MHW treatments (reached at 0.5C/hr) were 15C, 18C, 1C, and 24C, no tidal component, for 72hr. Surviving O. lurida were outplanted in Sacramento for 9 months (March 2022 - Dec. 2022).\nVery little mortality (&lt;10%) in all species/treatments during hardening/MHW test, and no significant effect of temp or tidal hardening on MHW survival. In O. lurida and C. sikamea, temp hardening had a negative impact on growth (i.e. 15C control was largest). However, in C. gigas, temp hardening had no effect on growth and tidal hardening improved growth. In outplanting, all O. lurida with tidal hardening died, but those hardened at 21C (fully submerged) had much higher survival than control (15C submerged).\n(Moyen et al. 2020):\nAdult, wild-caught M. californianus hardened at 25C, 30C, or 35C for 2hr, then recovered at 14C for 1-28 days, then underwent stress test at 40C for 2hr. Following stress test, back in 14C and monitered for 4 weeks. 30C hardening conferred improved heat tolerance for 14 days, and the 35C hardening improved survival for 21 days after extreme stress, but effect gone by day 28.\nThis experimental design has a great component of waiting 4 weeks after extreme stress to evaluate mortality. I really like this idea, since stress could kill after the actual event is over. Also, test temperatures selected because 25C was lowest temp at which HSPs are upregulated in species, 35C is ~1C below species’ critical temperature of cardiac function, and 40C is avg lethal temp in species. Also has a cool graph of # days between heat stress bouts.\n“Heat hardening has typically been defined as a transient response that confers improved heat tolerance immediately after the initial heat-stress bout for up to 32 h [9,12,13,39,40], while longer-lasting improvements in heat tolerance are termed as heat acclimation.”\n(Scanes et al. 2023):\nAustralian adult, hatchery-reared S. glomerata acclimated for 1 week at 23C. Two emmersion heat treatments, 30C and 40C. First hardening 1.5hr, back to ambient 1 wk, then three more hardening treatments of 2 hrs each, separated by 1 wk each time (total of 4 hardening treatments over 4 weeks). Simulated MHW 1wk after final hardening, kept at emmersed 50C for 2hr. Monitered for 48 hr, then checked at day 8 and 16. Also note there’s an antibiotic group, since study investigates pathogen load.\n40C hardening improved survival and growth, but 30C did not. Also, control+antibiotic oysters had improved survival. Suggests hardening may be bolstering capacity to repel pathogenic bacteria as one mechanism of improving post-HW survival.\n(He et al. 2021):\nAdult, wild-caught P. maxima oysters acclimated at 24C for 1 day, then exposed to MHW conditions at 28C and 32C for 3 days, 3 days recovery, followed by another exposure and recovery. Note that 36C treatment also attempted but saw 100% mortality. Observed significant changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes, biomineralization-related enzymes, and energy-metabolizing enzymes. Note this isn’t actually a hardening experiment, it’s a repeat MHW exposure experiment. It’s energetics-focused though, so should probably read in more depth at some point.\n(Giomi et al. 2016):\nWild-caught tropical oyster I. nucleus, acclimated at 26C for 1month. Emmersed at 26C (control) and 40C for 4 hrs, then immersed again in 26C and 35C (reciprocal exposure setup, 4 treatment combos total). Temperature-induced mortality rate and 50% lethal temp then measured, plus respirometry and hsp70 mRNA expression. Thermal tolerance, lethal temperature threshold, and oxygen consumption rates significantly improved in heat-stressed group (40C-26c and 40C-35C), and hsp70 expression increased. Interestingly though, feeding rates following stress were much lower in the heat-stressed groups.\nSimilar resilience evaluation approach to what we’re thinking in own project (quantifying temperature induced mortality and 50% lethal temp as a biomarker)\n\nMHW definition is pretty distinct, would need to decide what type of scenario to simulate\nNeed to figure out sample sizes for whatever tests I want to do. Would be benefited by running some test assays before starting experiment. A bunch of these assays have been used with Pacific oysters already, so could find those and make a table or something. \nApparently heartbeat is potentially a better metric for metabolic rate than respiration, and is nondestructive\nShould also keep in mind that genetic composition can completely change the true sample size (e.g., if triploids and diploids are siblings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBreese, Wilbur P, and Robert E Malouf. 1975. “Hatchery Manual for the Pacific Oyster.” Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program Agricultural Experiment Station (443). https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/db78td066.\n\n\nChávez-Villalba, Jorge, Julien Pommier, Jimmy Andriamiseza, Stéphane Pouvreau, Jean Barret, Jean-Claude Cochard, and Marcel Le Pennec. 2002. “Broodstock Conditioning of the Oyster Crassostrea Gigas: Origin and Temperature Effect.” Aquaculture 214 (1): 115–30. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(01)00898-5.\n\n\nGiomi, Folco, Concetta Mandaglio, Monthon Ganmanee, Guo-Dong Han, Yun-Wei Dong, Gray A.

Ineligible study includes pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions for disease or disorder prevention, prophylaxis, diagnosis, therapy, or treatment. Research to provide evidence leading to a scientific basis for consideration of a change in health policy or standard of care is not eligible. Graduate study focused on community, public, or global health, or other population-based research including medical intervention trials is also not eligible.\nc) Ineligible proposed research\n(i) Research for which the goals are directly human disease- or health-related, including the etiology, diagnosis, and/or treatment of disease or disorder is not eligible for support. Research activities using animal models of disease, for developing or testing of drugs or other procedures for treatment of disease or disorder are not eligible.\n(ii) Research focused on basic questions in plant pathology are eligible, however, applied studies focused on maximizing production in agricultural plants or impacts on food safety, are not eligible.\n(iii) Research with implications that inform policy is eligible. Research with the expressed intent to influence, advocate for, or effect specific policy outcomes is not eligible.\nd) Limited exceptions to ineligible proposed research\n(i) Certain areas of bioengineering research directed at medical use are eligible. These include research projects in bioengineering to aid persons with disabilities, or to diagnose or treat human disease or disorder, provided they apply engineering principles to problems in medicine while primarily advancing engineering knowledge. Applicants planning to study and conduct research in these areas of bioengineering should select biomedical engineering as the field of study.\n(ii) Certain areas of materials research directed at development of materials for use in biological or biomedical systems are eligible, provided they are focused on furthering fundamental materials research.\n(iii) Certain areas of research with etiology-, diagnosis-, or treatment-related goals that advance fundamental knowledge in engineering, mathematical, physical, computer or information sciences, are eligible for support.\nAquaculture and other forms of animal farming is not specifically mentioned, but the emphasis seems to be that research should be intended to advance fundamental knowledge.

See previous post for materials and Ariana’s post for project details.\nOrganism: Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)\nLifestages: Seed, Spat, Juvenile, Adult\nFor each of the four life stages, Eric had already performed an original conditioning treatment. We an additiol reciprocal exposure to acute stress. For example, half of the spat “control” group was exposed to the 32*C “high” stress, half of the “control” group was left in ambient temperature, half of the “treated” spat group was exposed to the 32*C “high” stress, and half of the “treated” spat group was left in ambient.\nConditioning treatment groups: Control, Treated\nAcute stress treatment groups: Ambient, High (32*C)\nPossible treatment group combinations: Control/Ambient, Control/High, Treated/Ambient, Treated/High\nFor each age class, each set of treatment conditions was sampled. Sampling was performed slightly differently for each age, due to size restrictions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge class\nSampling approach (for each of the 4 treatment combinations)\n\n\n\n\nSpat\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Whole animals were preserved, since the spat are too small to easily extract tissue from the shell.\n\n\nSeed\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Seed are larger than spat, so we were able to crack open the shell of each animal and preserve the whole animal tissue.\n\n\nJuvenile\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Juveniles are large enough to open the shell and differentiate between tissue types, but too small to split gill tissue into multiple samples, so the entire gill tissue of each animal was sampled.\n\n\nAdult\nOverview: 24 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=8, DNA n=8, frozen n=8) from 8 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 8 animals total. From each animal, gill tissue was extracted and separated into three portions, which were preserved for RNA, DNA, and flash frozen. This means we have “sets” of samples for the adults (e.g. a sample preserved for RNA work is associated with a sample preserved for DNA and a sample that was flash frozen, since all three are from the same animal), with a total of 24 samples for each treatment combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl/Ambient\nControl/High\nTreated/Ambient\nTreated/High\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nSpat\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nSeed\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nJuvenile\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nAdult\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 32\nDNA: 32\nfrozen: 32\n96 total\n\n\nTotal\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 104\nDNA: 104\nfrozen: 92\n300 total samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe oysters (each age class and treatment group in individual tubes or bags)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA juvenile oyster during sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOysters post-sampling"

(I think this is super cool!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nwarning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nimportant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip with Title\n\n\n\ntip\n(This is an example of a callout with a title)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Collapse\n\n\n\n\n\nand caution\nThis is an example of a ‘folded’ caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use collapse=\"true\" to collapse it by default or collapse=\"false\" to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n\n\n\nYou can also adjust the appearance of callouts in your doc\n\n\nCode annotation\nYou can insert footnote-like in-code anotations. This seems potentially redundant if you have good commenting in your code but it could still help make code explanations more digestible. You can also adjust how the annotation will appear using the code-annotations: command in the document YAML.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n1penguins |&gt;\n2  mutate(\n    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm,\n    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm\n  )\n\n1\n\nTake penguins, and then,\n\n2\n\nadd new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor tools\nThere are a whooooolllllleeee bunch of different options for specifying different author/article information that’s normally included in scientific publications (authors, affiliations, corresponding, copyright, orcid ID, abstract, keywords, etc.).

    "section": "",
    "text": "While writing some script to generate a transcriptome fasta using a CDS gff and scaffold genome, I ran into the question of how exactly the bedtools getfasta tool handles gff and bed file inputs. While both gff and bed files list basically the same types of sequence information, they list the genomic coordinates of the sequences slightly differently. gff files use a 1-based system, while bed files use a 0-based system (for details on how those differ, see this website post that I found helpful!). Bedtools states in the documentation for it’s getfasta function that gff files are accepted as input, but it isn’t made clear whether bedtools will treat the genomic coordinates in a gff file as 1-based, or as the o-based system used in bedtool’s more standard file format, bed.\nTo test whether bedtools can appropriately identify and parse both gff and bed files, I wrote some quick test files to run through bedtools getfasta.\nWrite the test files:\n\n\necho -e \"&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\" &gt; test_input.fasta\necho -e \"AAAGGGTTTCCCAAAGGGTTTCCC\" &gt;&gt; test_input.fasta\n\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t1\\t5\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt; test_input.gff\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t11\\t15\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt;&gt; test_input.gff\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t20\\t20\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000002\" &gt;&gt; test_input.gff\n\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t0\\t5\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt; test_input.bed\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t10\\t15\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt;&gt; test_input.bed\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t19\\t20\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000002\" &gt;&gt; test_input.bed\n\nexport PATH=/home/shared/bedops_linux_x86_64-v2.4.41/bin:$PATH\n\n${bedops}/gff2bed --do-not-sort &lt; test_input.gff &gt; test_input_gfftobed.bed\n\nRun through bedtools getfasta:\n\nsource .bashvars\ncd ~/deep-dive/E-Peve/data\n\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input.gff -fo test_gff_to_fasta.fasta\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input.bed -fo test_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input_gfftobed.bed -fo test_gff_to_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n\nhead test_gff_to_fasta.fasta\necho \"\"\nhead test_bed_to_fasta.fasta\necho \"\"\nhead test_gff_to_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n\nOutput:\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T  \n\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T  \n\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T\nAll three files resulted in identical FASTA outputs !

I liked a lot of things about the narration itself. Some of the voice options were very human-like and easy to listen to, and it did a pretty good (though not perfect) job of pronouncing uncommon jargon. On the other hand, I disliked several aspects of how it displays the content you’ve uploaded while it’s narrating it. Upon uploading a pdf, all of the text is extracted and displayed in a sectioned viewing pane that is completely removed from the original pdf (see below). That means that, in order to refer to figures or find “where” what you’re listening to is in the original document , you have to navigate to a completely separate pane to view the original pdf. Audemic also doesn’t track in-text where the reader is at that time, so it’s very difficult to find where you are in the text. Finally, there are a couple annoying things, like buggy Zotero uploading and being unable to switch “voice” without re-uploading the document.\nOverall, given the many features I find annoying and the still-high price tag, I’m not sure Audemic is worth the money, but it is the most human-like option I’ve found so far."

    "text": "Voice Dream\nPrice: $80/yr\nFree Trial: 3 days (but can’t try without providing payment info😑)\nFeatures:\n\nOffline access and multi-device, and available as an iOS app\nSkips in-text citations\nCan annotate/highlight in-text\nCan change the background color, font, and reading speed\nMany options for customizing text navigation\n\nHonestly I came into Voice Dream kind of biased against it, because I think its recent price hike, from a one-time fee of $30 (April 2023) to $80/yr, and its requirement of payment info to access the free trial are kind of scummy practices. Objectively though, it does seem like a decent option.\nThe real strengths of Voice Dream seem to lie in its customizable text navigation features. For example, you can choose your forward and backward “skip” buttons to skip by different time intervals, by paragraph, by heading, etc. You can set a timer for how long the narration will read, and can change a variety of visual settings (font, spacing, background color, etc.). When reading you can choose to view the text in either a plain text viewing pane or in the original document and both options support an in-text speech cursor to show where the narration is.\nHowever, several of the boasted features fell flat to me. While there are a ton of voices to choose from, all of the ones I tried are much more synth-sounding than Audemic, in both tone and inflection. Pronunciation of jargon is also not as good as Audemic, though there does seem to be a feature for correcting pronunciation of individual words. As in Audemic, your voice selection is document-specific, so you have to re-select the voice you want every time. While the website claims Voice Dream skips citations and superfluous text, when I uploaded a pdf and tried listening it didn’t skip either of these. It also didn’t identify sections for my uploaded pdf (e.g. Abstract, Intro, etc.), so I couldn’t use the section navigation option. On top of these disappointing features, some features are missing entirely. Voice Dream has no web app, so you can’t listen from a PC or Android, and there’s no option to import directly from Zotero or PaperPile, meaning manual upload is required.\nUltimately I know the quality of the voice is going to be much more important for my retention than text navigation features, so I don’t think Voice Dream is a good option for me. The voices are just too robotic, especially in comparison with Audemic."

    "text": "Speechify\nPrice: $140/yr\nFree Trial: 3 days (with providing payment info😑), but there’s also a free basic plan that you can use for as long as you want!\nFeatures:\n\nMulti-device, and can add files and listen from both web app and iOS app\nCan connect to Canvas to add class-related docs directly\nCan generate AI summary\nOptions to skip a whole bunch of in-text stuff (headers/footers, citations, brackets, braces, urls, footnotes)\nHas an ambient sound option!\nCan change text appearance.\nTracks where in-text the narration is\nOffline option, though the available voices are more limited and less human-like\nCan change reading speed\nIntegrated chatGPT, so you can ask it questions inside the speechify app and listen to the responses\n\nJust like Voice Dream, I didn’t want to like Speechify when I first started trying it out. It’s very expensive, and the price was increased in the last month from an already high $120/yr to a staggering $140/yr. After trying it out, though, I think this may be my favorite option!\nSpeechify has all of the standard text navigation/viewing options (in-text tracker, can view original document or transcribed reading pane with viewing features, adjustable reading speed, skip citations+, etc.), but there are two features that really stand out to me. The first is that a lot of the voices are very lifelike and easy for me to listen to, which is really important to me. The second is their ambient sound option, which allows you to play background sound (e.g. music on Spotify, white noise) at an automatically lowered volume while the app narrates text on top. This is super cool for me! I’ve been looking for something like this for a really long time, because when I work out I want to play music with a suitable beat, but I also want to listen to audiobooks or something because I get bored quickly – that’s exactly what this feature does! The last cool feature that also deserves a mention is Speechify’s AI integration. You can generate AI summaries of any document, and you can ask questions to chatGPT in the speechify app and then listen to the responses.\nMost of my annoyances with Speechify are pretty minor. Like most of the other options, Speechify doesn’t have a way to upload documents directly from Zotero (or any other reference manager), which makes the process more tedious. There’s also no feature to separate text into navigable sections (e.g. Intro, Methods), and you can’t annotate in-app, so you’d need to switch to a different tool to make notes, highlight, etc."

It has also has a nice chrome extension, which allows you to send papers directly from the source websites, and has some nice life-like voices.\nThere are some features that are missing though. There no way to change the background color, font, and text size, and there’s no option to see the original pdf instead of a transcribed reading window. It also takes a while to upload new files (~3 min/doc), which could quickly get annoying, and there are no options for integrating with any popular reference managers.\nListening.io seems like a decent option, but considering it has the same exorbitant price as Speechify it’s a little underwhelming.

FUN_004083 – Dipeptidyl Peptidase II (DPP II)\n\nFunction: Removes N-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides.\nEnergy Role: Involved in protein turnover, indirectly influencing energy homeostasis. (ScienceDirect)\n\nIn Aptasia, Dipeptidyl peptidase 2 proteins are less abundant in anemones colonized by symbionts (Sproles et al. 2019)\nVarious ncRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of dipeptidyl peptidase genes (though not DPP2 specifically)\n\n\n\n3.

FUN_007022 – Cryptochrome-1 (CRY1)\n\nFunction: Core component of the circadian clock.\nEnergy Role: Modulates metabolic pathways in a time-dependent manner, influencing energy metabolism. (PMC)\n\nIn vertebrates and insects, cryptochromes are involved in regulation fo the circadian rhythm.\nIn corals, cryptochromes are likely involved in photoreception. For example, in Acropora millepora, cryptochromes have been reported to be preferentially expressed in light, including some types showing differential expression based on lunar cycle, suggesting a potential role in behavior synchronization, such as mass spawning (Levy et al. 2007).\nIn plants, cryptochrome expression is linked to expression of miRNA and lncRNA. For example, in the algae Saccharina japonica, expression of a type of cryptochrome is regulated by an miRNA and several lncRNA (Yang et al. 2020) (the implicated miRNA does not match Cluster_17173)\n\n\n\n7. FUN_008296 – E3 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Synoviolin (SYVN1)\n\nFunction: Tags proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\nEnergy Role: Regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism through modulation of PGC-1β.

FUN_028200 – 26S Proteasome Regulatory Subunit 6B (RPT3)\n\nFunction: Part of the 26S proteasome complex, involved in protein degradation.\nEnergy Role: Regulates protein turnover, influencing energy metabolism and cellular homeostasis.\n\n26S proteasome regulatory subunit 6B is part of the multiprotein 26S proteasome complex, which removes misfolded or damaged proteins.\nIn Aptasia-associated symbionts, 26S proteasome regulatory subunit 6B is upregulated in response to both heat and salinity stress (and their interaction), as are many other types of proteasome subunits (Giovagnoli 2023)\n\n\n\n17. FUN_032220 – Dihydrolipoyllysine-Residue Acetyltransferase (PDCE2)\n\nFunction: Core component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.\nEnergy Role: Links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, central to aerobic energy production.\n\nDifferentially expressed in corals under heat stress (e.g., Zhang et al. 2024, Sun et al. 2025)\nPutatively targeted by miRNA in plants (http://isyslab.info/OPP-ncRBASE/search/mirna/31056)\n\n\n\n18.

(Zhang et al., 2024)\nPEPCK is also differentially expressed under heat stress and bleaching (e.g., Kenkel et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2018, Kenkel et al. 2014), which suggests its involvement in compensating for loss of symbiont-derived nutrients.\nMultiple classes of ncRNA have recently been identified as putative regulators of glucose metabolism, in which phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase plays a key role (e.g., Lai et al., 2020)\n\n\n\n21.

FUN_041721 – Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase IB Subunit Alpha2\n\nFunction: Same as FUN_011908; hydrolyzes platelet-activating factor.\nEnergy Role: Involved in lipid signaling pathways related\n\n\n\n\n26 & 27. FUN_042950 – TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2 (TRAF2)\n\nFunction: E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor protein involved in TNF receptor signaling, activating NF-κB and MAPK pathways, crucial for inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis.\nEnergy Role: Regulates cellular stress responses, which can influence mitochondrial function, cell metabolism, and energy balance, especially under inflammatory or oxidative stress. (NCBI Gene: TRAF2)\n\nIn general, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) play a role in apoptosis, and are associated with immune response. TRAF2, specifically, suppresses apoptosis and necroptosis (Petersen et al. 2015) In humans, dysregulation of TNFs and TRAFs is implicated in several cancer types. TRAF2 has also been implicated as part of an immune regulation network that is modulated by both miRNA and lncRNA (Ebrahimi & Golestani 2021).\nIn Acropora hyacinthus, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 is downregulated in response to bleaching (Barshis et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n28.

This could be due to small sample size (though this seems less likely sigen N=40), invariant data, noise, or because expression of some genes is driven by features not included in our predictor set (e.g. transcription factors). The final option seems most likely to me.\nThere may, however, be a subset of genes whose expression is primarily driven by our epigenetic mechanisms. Bootstrapping should help us identify this subset, if it exists. I’ll run model training/testing many times and see which genes are consistently well-predicted."

Ensure The source and target columns are appropriately identified before loading the file.\nTo load “Nodes” file, select File &gt; Import &gt; Table from File…\n\n\n\nResults\nBelow is a the network of miRNA-gene and miRNA-lncRNA interactions that are predicted to bind by miRanda, and which have an expression correlation coefficient above 0.5.\nThe network is displayed using the yFiles Organic Layout, with nodes colored by type (miRNA = orange, lncRNA = dark blue, gene = light blue), and with edges colored by correlation direction (negative = red, positive = green) and weighted by correlation magnitude.\n\nWe can see some interesting patterns!\n\nCluster_4752 stands out because it has many putative interactions (mostly genes), with primarily negatively correlated expression. This suggests the miRNA is reducing expression of its target genes through translational repression or mRNA degradation. Note also that this miRNA matches miR-2023.\n\nCluster_5603 appears to putatively interact with one of the largest proportions of lncRNA. It matches the previously described miRNA “Novel-5_3p”.\n\nCluster_17192 is primarily of interest becasue it matches miR-100, a highly conserved and well described miRNA. It also becomes apparent after isolation that one of the putative gene targets, FUN_014449, has a remarkable number of edges connecting it to Cluster_17192. This indicates that miRanda output a significant likelihood of Cluster_17192 binding to many different location on the mRNA\nWe can check exactly how many:\n\nmiRNA_gene %&gt;% filter(PCC_magnitude &gt; 0.5 & interaction == \"Cluster_17192 _ FUN_014449\") %&gt;% nrow()\n\n[1] 129\n\n\n\nCluster_9532 matches miR-2022, about which we actually know a fair bit of functional information!\nI have a notebook post detailing what functional information we have for previously described miRNA, here"

In it, I:\nFrankly, this is sooooo much data and I didn’t figure out a great way to summarize all of the results in a visual or digestible way. Here a few summary figures:\nWhich traits have the most significantly correlated modules/genes?\nFor traits of interest, what biological processes are overrepresented, and what overlap is there among traits of interest?\nThe true value of these analyses will require identifying a trait/module/miRNA of interest and the looking at what functions are enriched for it. I’ve been playing around with some interaction network visualizations, similarly to what I did with the miRanda/Pcor results, but this includes many more genes and is thus much more computationally intensive and would make the visualization less helpful\nCode copied below in case of file path changes:\nAfter running WGCNA to evaluate modules of mRNA and miRNA with correlated expression, we need to functionally annotate genes to evaluate module function(s)."

Parent=Peve_00000001\nA gff file lists information that can be used to identify and retrieve specific sequences. The first column lists the region or scaffold of a reference genome in which the sequence can be found; the third identifies which genomic feature (e.g., mRNA, CDS, UTR) the sequence is; and the fourth and fifth are genomic coordinates for the beginning and end of the sequence. Since we have both the coding sequences gff and a reference fasta, we should be able to extract FASTA sequences for all of the relevant sequences in the gff!\n\n\nExtract CDS sequences\nFirst, it looks like the gff has features labelled a little weirdly. Normally we’d want all of the mRNA sequences, but it looks like this file lists mRNA sequences that include introns. Instead, we want all of the CDS sequences associated with each mRNA (association is denoted in the final column with a parent mRNA ID, e.g. “Parent=Peve_00000001”). That means the first step is to extract all of the CDS sequences from our gff file.\n\n# Extract only the CDS sequence lines from the gff\ngrep -w 'CDS' ${transcriptome_gff} &gt; ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\n\nhead -n 5 ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\n\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove   CDS 3107    3444    .   -   .

Parent=Peve_00000002\n\n\nConvert gff to bed\nThen we convert this filtered CDS gff file to a bed file, which has slightly different formatting. We’re doing this because we’ll be using a tool called bedtools getfasta, which can take both gff and bed files, but which I trust more to appropriately parse bed files (though, see post on whether it can handle gff files correctly as well).\n\n# Ensure bedops can find its dependencies when running\nexport PATH=/home/shared/bedops_linux_x86_64-v2.4.41/bin:$PATH\n\n${bedops}/gff2bed \\\n--do-not-sort \\\n&lt; ${transcriptome_gff_filtered} \\\n&gt; ${transcriptome_bed}\n\nhead -n 3 ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\necho \"\"\nhead -n 3 ${transcriptome_bed}\n\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove   CDS 3107    3444    .   -   .

Each sequence with the same parent ID should be used to a) retrieve a FASTA for that sequence, and b) concatenate all of the FASTAs with the same parent ID into a single, labelled gene FASTA.

While trying (and failing) to remove duplicates with the fastx_toolkit fastx_collapser, Steven pointed out that the gff file (image below) I’m using contains sequences labeled as both CDS and mRNA sequences, and suggested I use only those labeled as mRNA.\n\nI selected only sequecnes labelled as “mRNA” in the gff, extracted those sequences fastas from the scaffold reference, and was able to successfully build a kallisto index, however I was given a warning that kallisto index had identified 10,722,052 non-ACGUT characters in the 40,389 input sequences (or ~265 non-ACGUT characters per sequence!). Quickly looking through some of the extracted sequence fastas, I found some of them contain long internal stretches of N characters.\n\nSam was able to inform me that this is due to the reference fasta I’m using to extract mRNA fastas. The reference is a scaffold, which characteristically contains arbitrary stretches of Ns connecting known sequences to others in the same region. Steven then also noticed that the gff file seems to be improperly labeled, with mRNA sequences that actually contain several CDS regions and introns, which could interfere with pseudoalignment. Instead, of using the labelled mRNAs, I may need to extract all the sequences labelled as CDS from the gff, obtain sequences fastas, group and concatenate by “Parent” (source mRNA) to exclude all of the introns, and then use those concatenated CDS fasta sequences as a reference for kallisto.\nSome pseudo code for doing this:\nstart with original.gff, which contains CDS, mRNA, UTR, etc. sequences\ngrep -w \"CDS\" original.gff &gt; filtered.gff\nnow I have a filtered gff that only contains info for CDS sequences in a format that looks like:\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000002\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000002\n…\nwhere each Parent ID (“Parent=Peve_00000001”) groups together CDS sequences that originate from the same mRNA. To get full concatenated fasta sequences for each mRNA I’ll do:\nfor i in #LinesInFiltered.gff:\n\n  get parentID of filtered.gff line i\n\n  if parentID not already in final.fasta:\n\n    extract all lines in filtered.gff with parentID\n    bedtools to get each lines' fasta sequence\n    concatenate all of these fastas\n    assign appropriate ID that includes parentID to concatenated fasta\n    add this parentID.fasta to final.fasta\nthis final.fasta should contain the same number of sequence fastas as unique parentIDs in filtered.gff"

No correlation w solar radiation of rainfall suggests temp should be driving differential gene expression by timepoint. DGE analysis showed TP2 and TP4 as having most DEGs, but TP2 and TP3 have the two temperature extremes (highest and lowest) and are the only TPs significantly correlated with modules of gene expression. Maybe this is because both hot and cold extremes are handled by the same pathways, so TP2 and 3 have very similar “dealing with temp stress” expression profiles that contrast with TP1 and 4 “we’re at a comfortable temp” expression profiles?\nAlso notable, while TP2 and TP3 are significantly correlated with some of the same modules, they have opposite expression profile (upregulation vs. downregulation! Does this suggest that, while both warm and cool temperature stress may be associated with similar pathways, the way those pathways are modulated in differs when in response to different types of temp stress (e.g. gene is upregulated in response to heat stress and downregulated in response to cold stress)?\n\nEdit 3/18/2025 – realized after plotting out eigengenes of each module that this ^^ is a misinterpretation of the heatmap – shared modules between TP2 and TP3 actually have matching expression profiles. This suggests shared pathways for both warm and cool temperature response and that the pathways are modulated in similar ways in response to both forms of temperature change.\n\n2 hr – QSCI381 lab\n0.5 hr – weekly meeting w Steven\n0.5 hr – Just announced that Trump admin gutted the Department of Education, leaving it at ~50% of original workforce, so I finally took a moment to check on my student loans and download digital copies of all relevant documentation, just in case.\n2.5 hr – working on E5 timeseries WGCNA (fixing data prep, correlating WGCNA modules, etc)\n\nDaily total: 11 hrs"

    "text": "Review January goals\n\nLog activities daily in Lab Notebook.\nLast quarter I got overwhelmed with work and stopped posting my daily activities in my lab notebook. I want to reinstate that habit!\nLog all data analysis work (e.g. running a WGCNA) in dedicated post in appropriate project page.\nSimilar to the first goal, I’ve been relying on Github to log all the analysis work I’ve been doing. That work should also be detailed in my lab notebook.\nSpend maximum 50 hours/week working. Log daily hours in Lab Notebook.\nLast quarter, with the intensive TA position, grant applications, committee prep, and transitioning to E5 expression work/leadership, I worked a lot, and I was really burned out by the end of the quarter. I want to hold myself accountable to a more manageable work schedule this quarter. This time logging will begin my first week back from SICB (Monday, Jan 13). I expect my time breakdown to be roughly:\n20hr/wk classes (SWED 101, FISH 513); 15hr/wk TAing (QSCI 381); 15hr/wk thesis work."

Now just monitoring the reminder for mortality because they’re taking forever to die, despite not being fed for a full month at this point. See the project page for more\n\n\nE5 coral\nThe deep dive manuscript is in final stages (hopefully), and as far as I know I’ve fulfilled my contributions to the miRNA methods, results, and discussion sections.\nI’ve also started looking at gene expression and coexpression, details on that are in the expression github\n\n\nNSF GRFP\nI’ve been to a couple of info sessions/writing workshops for the NSF GRFP and have created my planning docs, updated CV, identified likely references, and started outlining my personal statement and research statement.\n\n\nDegree progress\nMy biggest goal this summer for degree progress was to nail down my committee and, due to sporadic personal and faculty availability, I unfortunately don’t have that yet. I thought I had my second SAFS faculty member, but they had to pull out due to personal reasons/needing to reduce commitments for this coming quarters. I’m contacting some other faculty though and hopefully I’ll have a replacement before the start of the quarter in ~3 weeks."

Currently need 5.5 credits to complete masters requirements (4.5 if CENV 590 can by counted toward degree – would need approval).

E.g., to what extent can E5 work be included in thesis?\n\nE5 work that I’ve completed is fully eligible\n\n\n\nThesis progress and brainstorming\nChapter 1: corals deep-dive (+ deep-dive-expression)\nI’ve currently completed miRNA/siRNA characterization and preliminary expression work. I’m in the process of characterizting patterns of sncRNA + mRNA coexpression. Will also incorporate DNA methylation mapping and sncRNA/methylation interaction analysis.\n\nwere methylation samples sent out? for deep dive\ncould also include coral hDNA methylation in this if I receive the SIFP\nlogical expansion into PhD thesis is looking at time series data\n\nChapter 2: environmental memory in oysters\n\nwe have data for oysters under OA exposure. Described in parents, but not yet touched children. In parents have gene expression and methylation (plus lncRNA from the RNAseq data)\nso I could look into heritability of methylation in oysters\nmethylation data from the offspring already exists!! (i.e., the samples have already been sequenced)\nside note: lab has already looked into barcoding bisulfite-converted DNA, but had limited success because their gene of interest was very long and bisulfite treatment degrades high-molecular-weight DNA. It would be interesting to develop some kind of screening protocol to screen for methylation patterns associate with resilience. (e.g., for broodstock screening)\n\n\n\nTo-Do:\nE5:\n\nFor each miRNA, calculate correlation coefficent with each gene\nLook into miRNA binding again (get software from Jill?)\ninteractions with lncRNA (get data from Zach). Could also do binding here, since lncRNAs may be sponges, precursors, etc.\ncross-species stuff could be interesting – gene orthologs? but can be back burner for now\ncorrelation between methylation in an miRNA-coding region and expression of that miRNA.\n\nGeneral:\n\ncan bring Hollie in now for committee\nschedule meeting with steven, weekly thursdays at 11"

How often are GO annotations originally identified/set in one taxa validated for application in other taxa? How would that work? Is it even necessary?\nSo Zhu et al. 2022 found symbiont-associated miRNAs in coral transcriptome, but also mentioned in intro that (in other studies) foreign miRNA presence was correlated with intake (e.g. when human ate certain plant associated miRNAs present in human serum, but would disappear if they stopped eating that plant). Does that mean that presence/function of symbiont miRNAs in corals change when the coral is bleached (aka, the symbionts are gone)? If some symbiont miRNAs may be affecting coral immune response, could this play into coral immunocompromisation during bleaching?\nHas there been any similar work with other taxa of Symbiodiniaceae?\n\nTrigg et al. 2021\nAlso, not from either of the papers, but I was kind of confused about Sam’s discussion of trying different trimming sizes to ID miRNAs. I’ve only taken a basic molgen class though, which didn’t go very in-depth in to how RNAs (especially ncRNAs) work, so this may be a basic knowledge gap. In contrast to DNA, where all of the different introns/exons, etc. are contained in one long strand of DNA, I thought transcribed RNAs were separate molecules. If that’s the case my understanding on how we sequence miRNAs is that we isolate all the RNAs of a very small size (20-30bp) and then sequence them – why, then, would trimming (beyond removing the adapters that facilitate enrichment) be necessary?

I backed up all my work to Gannet, then undid all my local commits, and recommitted/pushed only the .gitignore file. Once it was pushed, I reran my code to generate all the outputs again, and was able to successfully commit and push.

For mice/rats shown to persist 6-7 generations, but will definitely vary among taxa. Lab works with species with longerish generations, so has only really gone out to F2 (second generation)\n\nWhat about acclimatization related to microbiome? For example, say a coral has a more heat resistant symbiont. Symbionts can be “inherited” by offspring through vertical transmission (parent to offspring) or obtained by the offspring through horizontal transmission (picking up symbionts from water column or other corals). If you “infect” a coral with a thermally-tolerant symbiont, how many generations end up with the same symbiont (on average)? (Ofc this information would be more applicable to understanding acclimatization in species with short generation times, aka not coral)\nDo we know whether specific conditions facilitate acclimation/acclimatization? I’m thinking of how adaptation is facilitated by things like high genetic diversity, population connectivity, etc – is there a proxy for acclimatization?\n\nepigenetic landscape, gene copy numbers (e.g. large #s of exons)\nhighly changeable environment also affects epigenome (why?)\n\nHuttenhofer, Schattner, & Poleacek 2005:\nThe paper often used the term “identified” (eg. “snoRNAs have been identified by experimental and computational means”) – what do they mean by this? Do they mean we know that a specific sequence is a snoRNA? That we know what it does?\n\nkind of both…?\n\nThe paper said “ncRNAs often lack the characteristic features used by genefinders for protein-coding genes” and, in contrast, “have widely varying motifs”. How, then, are ncRNAs identified? The paper mentions their “secondary structure” – what does this mean?\n\n\n\nMentioned the possibility of siRNAs being used as a applied tool to treat human disease because of their possible functionality in changing expression of disease-related genes.

I thought the term encompassed any RNA that was non-coding, including potentially non-functional RNA bits…\n\nkind of a semantics issue\n\nIn corals seeing a high prop of short ncRNAs that can’t be classified as miRNAs\nDon’t know if there are taxa-specific features of different ncRNA classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTREQ is apparently undergoing system modifications right now, so I can’t get added to the system. That means I can’t individually register and submit purchasing requests for SICB. Instead, I’ve been advised to register for the conference and then submit necessary information to Jonas Louie so they can submit a reimbursement request on my behalf.\nQuestions for Science Hour:\nDo we know how long (i.e. across how many generations) transgenerational/epigenetic acclimatization lasts?\nWhat about acclimatization related to microbiome?

I thought the term encompassed any RNA that was non-coding, including potentially non-functional RNA bits…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling up from the blast tutorial yesterday, I was able to run the code Steven added to the cod project repo to blast and annotate a cod transcriptome! I was also able to log in to my new Gannet account and get it set up, so I should (theoretically) be able to store large files there now. I’m still not 100 sure how I would do that though. I’ve read through some old Github issues and stuff and I think I’d need to either ssh or rsync to connect to Gannet from Raven and then copy over the large files using that connection. I’m not not familiar with rsync, so I’m not sure what the difference between ssh and rsync is or which is preferable. I also am not 100% sure what the server host name/IP address would be to ssh into Gannet, but I’m guessing I can use the IP that Gannet emailed to me. Since I’m not confident in correctly connecting and copying to Gannet from Raven I haven’t uploaded the blast/annotation output files or pushed anything from running the rmd to github. I’ll either ask about it in lab tomorrow or Science Hour on Friday.\nI’m also still not sure what a lot of the code from Steven’s blast/annotation code is doing, so I want to do a deep-dive into the commands being run.\nLastly, I finally took a moment to try registering for SICB only to find out I don’t have access to the College of Environment purchasing system, Treq. I requested access through the indicated email and will ask about it during Friday Science Hour if I don’t hear back by then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several weeks of accumulating issues with running command line and working in RStudio/Github (both locally and on Raven), I think I’ve finally resolved them all! I was able to run the tutorial blast code successfully (I think). I still want to figure out/ask about the function of all the parameters called (e.g. -evalue 1E-20), and to figure out how to interpret the output results (or at least learn how to identify possible issues in the output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevelations from lab meeting today! Several of my Raven problems were solved during our raven/github-focused meeting today – notes below:\n\nConnecting Raven with my Github. I needed to enter\n```{bash} git config –global user.email \"[mygithubemailthatIdon'twanttopublicize]\"   git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"```\nand then log in to git using my username and a personal access token (which I have now created). I’m now fully connected to github from Raven and have successfully pushed/pulled!\nGetting/accessing ncbi blast software on Raven. Blast is indeed already downloaded and accessible on Raven, it’s just in a higher-level directory that I couldn’t find because I didn’t know about it (I can only default view my home directory on Raven). The higher-level lab directory is /home/shared, and ncbi-blast v. 2.12.0 is already installed there!\nPushing large files to Github. Don’t! Any file (e.g. output file) sizes larger than 100MB should not be pushed to Github - instead, put it on Gannet (another lab server intended for large-file-size data and output storage). Already github-issued Sam/Steven to ask for access to Gannet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter fairly continuous head-bashing (pun intended ;) ) with RStudio/bash/blast for the last two weeks I’m kind of tired of it, so today I’m going to focus on other stuff – like setting some goals! I’ve had ~3 weeks now to get settled into the lab and Steven and I have had the chance to talk about possible directions for the near future, so let’s put some stuff in writing – see October Goals post for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI continued trying to figure out how to work in Raven today and ran into another fun problem – my Raven RStudio isn’t connected to my github, even though I copied the directory I’m working in directly from Github in the same way I would copy a repo to RStudio on my local machine. I realized I wasn’t able to commit or push/pull, and using the command ```{bash} git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"``` didn’t fix the issue. It clearly isn’t an issue with my shell script/terminal because I’ve been successfully running command line code on Raven. Maybe Raven isn’t supposed to end up tied to github? I would think the code and stuff should all end up on github for backup/reproducibility purposes, but I can also see why sending some things to github (e.g. output files) could require an unreasonable amount of storage…\nI also managed to modify the 001-blast.Rmd tutorial script to download a windows version of ncbi blast to Raven and run the .exe, but I wasn’t able to successfully access the blast.exe component used in the first task of the tutorial file (setting blast directory). Neither I nor google can figure out why with a cursory search and I unfortunately have class soon, but in the worst case I can bring this up at lab meeting on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam was able to resend me login credentials for Raven (the Lab’s primary server, implemented through a browser version of RStudio), so I started getting situated on it. Since I have a pending task related to blasting a cod transcriptome, I copied over my github repo RobertsLab_OnboardingTasks and took another look at the blast tutorial .Rmd file (001-blast.Rmd). The last time I tried to run this tutorial file (on RStudio locally) I ran into problems running bash through RStudio at all.\nThankfully that isn’t an issue working in Raven, but now I’m kind of stumped because of the need to download and run blast. I can’t find any “higher level” directories above my own Raven account that might hold relevant software like ncbi-blast, but it seems weird that I’d need to individually download the software for use on a shared server…The code included in the tutorial file for this also wouldn’t work on my machine, since it’s written with Mac-specific and outdated versions of blast. I downloaded the most recent Windows version of blast to my local machine, but I don’t think I can access local software from Raven since it’s a server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finished the cod temp/growth analysis assigned by Steven\n\n\n\nI’m still having issues with the disconnect between which shell script is being used by my terminal and which is used by console in R. We realized today that my problems pushing my analysis code to the lab’s project-cod-temperature repo on github were related to the disconnect problem. I was able to pull and push to github when I was working within the repo on RStudio, but I couldn’t commit using the Git environment in the upper right pane. However, pushing, pulling, and committing manually from the terminal all worked fine. We think that, somehow, the commit action in the Git environment is using the same faulty WSL shell that my console is defaulting to, even though the push/pull actions are correctly defaulting to Git Bash. To make matters even more confusing, when I’m working within my lab notebook repo in RStudio I’m able to push, pull, and commit successfully from the Git environment with no issues. Why is my default shell script for console/some parts of git different between repos/RStudio projects?\nNo answers yet, but for right now I’m still able to maintain functionality while working locally because the terminal is functioning appropriately and I have a workaround to run bash code chunks included in Rmd files (see Oct.12 post).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I may have fixed the issue running bash code chunks in Rmd files! Included the following:\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(bash='C:/Program Files/Git/git-bash.exe'))\n\nAnd now, while I still don’t seem to get any output when I try to run individual code chunks by pressing the “play” button in the top right corner, knitting the document works! I still haven’t figured out how to permanently set the default shell script for running bash code chunks from Rmd files (checking default shell using “Sys.which(”bash”)” from the console still returns “C::\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe” aka WSL), so for now I guess I’ll just have to include that YAML block in any Rmd file I’m working in.\nStarted working on cod temp/size data analysis assigned by Steven but haven’t been able to push to the lab Github repo (project-cod-temperature) bc, while I successfully cloned the repo to RStudio, I haven’t been able to connect them so I’m able to push changes back to it. Will ask about it during Science Hour tomorrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve continued trying to troubleshoot my issues with running bash code chunks in .Rmd files. Running Sys.which(“bash”) in the RStudio console the path “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe”, which I think is bash installed as a part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started looking at the github tasks Steven assigned me to familiarize me with Raven and the lab’s computing practices (analyzing some weight/temp data and BLASTing/annotating a transcriptome), but quickly ran into setup issues. I made a new github repo using the lab’s project template and tried running through one of the blast tutorials included in the project template, but immediately had problems with running the bash code chunks. I’ve done command-line data analysis work before, but never through an Rmarkdown file or in RStudio. When I tried to run any of the bash code chunks nothing would happen, not even an error output. First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin? I’ll try more troubleshooting tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted an additional employee training and went over my lit review questions (see Oct.5 entry) with Steven. Also github-issued Sam about getting added to Raven.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\n\nA: adenine is only methylated in certain taxa (e.g. bacteria), and isn’t methylated in marine inverts\n\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable? Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\nA: Differs among taxa. We have secondary evidence that it is in marine inverts. For taxa where there’s more evidence, modification has to happen during early developmental stages of gonads (presumably to alter the gamete cells). A lot of it is unknown though (similar for other forms of modification e.g. histone modification)\n\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 (Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation…)\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 studied polyploidy in oysters because of its common use in oyster aquaculture – does polyploidy have any potential conservation applications, particularly in eukaryotes, for whom ployploidy is often better tolerated? One scenario I can think of is intentional hybridization of two species to selectively breed a more resilient population – since polyploidy is more common in hybrids, may be important to understand its impacts. I also know polyploidy sometimes happens in corals (especially Caribbean corals), which can reproduce asexually fairly easily. (Need to read related paper Stephens et al. 2023 – w/ Putnam and Bhattacharya!)\n\nA: Since polyploidy reduces breeding potential so could be useful in conservation. But don;t have any information on relationship between polyploidy and methylation or the mechanisms of how polyploidy affects methylation\n\nConfused about a couple aspects of the experimental setup:\n\nStated that lab obtained 500 oysters for the experiment, but then states that the starting sample size of each of the six treatments (2 controls, 2 single stressor, 2 multiple stressors) was 112, which adds to way over 500 oysters\n\nA:\n\nFor the multiple stressors treatment, why was aerial exposure not repeated multiple times (since low tide happens on a regular daily schedule, not just once during a given warming event)?\n\nA: Don’t want to go overboard and kill all the oysters, so start out trying with less stressful stress conditions. Want to understand more than just the death outcome.\n\n\nIn Results, why is survival probability not the direct inverse of mortality?\n\nA: doesn’t know, maybe check supplemental materials or ask in Slack\n\nI think I noticed some typos… do you want to know about them or just leave it be?\n\nPutnam et al. 2023 (Dynamic DNA methylation contributes to carryover effects…)\n\nIn the results section I saw that shell area was used as a proxy for shell size – is it assumed that shell thickness remains fairly constant? Do we know this will hold during acidification? Also, are shell size and body mass tightly correlated? (I would assume so, but it would be interesting if acidic conditions messed with that relationship)\n\nA: Not assumed, but it wasn’t measured. Emma Tidman paper looks at effect of acidification on various measures of shell strength/size.\nA: Emma also looked at body mass/tissue impacts of acidification (but yes, there is generally a correlation between shell size and body mass)\n\nIn Fig.3 I’m a little confused about the y-axes of 3c and 3d – what is the baseline (the “1”) for these relative size values? It doesn’t seem like it could be original size (as in a and b)\n\nA: check supplemental\n\nWhat is the difference between differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs)? Are DMRs just methylation of non-coding DNA (e.g. introns)?\n\nA: Regions are just more broad than genes (so regions could contain genes). The scale (in terms of number of bp) goes loci -&gt; genes -&gt; regions.\n\nI have no idea what’s going on in figure 4 :(\n\nA: each cell represents gene and the z-score is basically showing a heatmap of gene expression. The “tree” looking thing is just showing clustering of individuals based on expression level.\n\nor figure 5\n\nA: Steven is also kind of confused about this rn, but check supplementals for more\n\nWhat are DEGs (pg12)? Also, are CpGs just cytosine/guanine pairs?\n\nDEG=Differentially expressed gene (rather than differentially methylated), and yes, CpGs are cytosine/guanine pairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued reading through recent lab publications (see entry from yesterday) and compiled some questions about them to ask Steven at Science Hour tomorrow (see below). I also completed the required HazCom training (and returned updated training documentation to Sam), requested access to the UW chemical inventory/safety system, and wrote and uploaded a personal description, lab notebook link, email, and picture, to the lab website.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable?

I was also able to log in to my new Gannet account and get it set up, so I should (theoretically) be able to store large files there now. I’m still not 100 sure how I would do that though. I’ve read through some old Github issues and stuff and I think I’d need to either ssh or rsync to connect to Gannet from Raven and then copy over the large files using that connection. I’m not not familiar with rsync, so I’m not sure what the difference between ssh and rsync is or which is preferable. I also am not 100% sure what the server host name/IP address would be to ssh into Gannet, but I’m guessing I can use the IP that Gannet emailed to me. Since I’m not confident in correctly connecting and copying to Gannet from Raven I haven’t uploaded the blast/annotation output files or pushed anything from running the rmd to github. I’ll either ask about it in lab tomorrow or Science Hour on Friday.\nI’m also still not sure what a lot of the code from Steven’s blast/annotation code is doing, so I want to do a deep-dive into the commands being run.\nLastly, I finally took a moment to try registering for SICB only to find out I don’t have access to the College of Environment purchasing system, Treq.

I can’t find any “higher level” directories above my own Raven account that might hold relevant software like ncbi-blast, but it seems weird that I’d need to individually download the software for use on a shared server…The code included in the tutorial file for this also wouldn’t work on my machine, since it’s written with Mac-specific and outdated versions of blast. I downloaded the most recent Windows version of blast to my local machine, but I don’t think I can access local software from Raven since it’s a server."

We realized today that my problems pushing my analysis code to the lab’s project-cod-temperature repo on github were related to the disconnect problem. I was able to pull and push to github when I was working within the repo on RStudio, but I couldn’t commit using the Git environment in the upper right pane. However, pushing, pulling, and committing manually from the terminal all worked fine. We think that, somehow, the commit action in the Git environment is using the same faulty WSL shell that my console is defaulting to, even though the push/pull actions are correctly defaulting to Git Bash. To make matters even more confusing, when I’m working within my lab notebook repo in RStudio I’m able to push, pull, and commit successfully from the Git environment with no issues. Why is my default shell script for console/some parts of git different between repos/RStudio projects?\nNo answers yet, but for right now I’m still able to maintain functionality while working locally because the terminal is functioning appropriately and I have a workaround to run bash code chunks included in Rmd files (see Oct.12 post)."

I still haven’t figured out how to permanently set the default shell script for running bash code chunks from Rmd files (checking default shell using “Sys.which(”bash”)” from the console still returns “C::\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe” aka WSL), so for now I guess I’ll just have to include that YAML block in any Rmd file I’m working in.\nStarted working on cod temp/size data analysis assigned by Steven but haven’t been able to push to the lab Github repo (project-cod-temperature) bc, while I successfully cloned the repo to RStudio, I haven’t been able to connect them so I’m able to push changes back to it.

    "text": "I’ve continued trying to troubleshoot my issues with running bash code chunks in .Rmd files. Running Sys.which(“bash”) in the RStudio console the path “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe”, which I think is bash installed as a part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful."

I made a new github repo using the lab’s project template and tried running through one of the blast tutorials included in the project template, but immediately had problems with running the bash code chunks. I’ve done command-line data analysis work before, but never through an Rmarkdown file or in RStudio. When I tried to run any of the bash code chunks nothing would happen, not even an error output. First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin? I’ll try more troubleshooting tomorrow."

Also github-issued Sam about getting added to Raven.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\n\nA: adenine is only methylated in certain taxa (e.g. bacteria), and isn’t methylated in marine inverts\n\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable? Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\nA: Differs among taxa. We have secondary evidence that it is in marine inverts. For taxa where there’s more evidence, modification has to happen during early developmental stages of gonads (presumably to alter the gamete cells). A lot of it is unknown though (similar for other forms of modification e.g. histone modification)\n\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 (Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation…)\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 studied polyploidy in oysters because of its common use in oyster aquaculture – does polyploidy have any potential conservation applications, particularly in eukaryotes, for whom ployploidy is often better tolerated? One scenario I can think of is intentional hybridization of two species to selectively breed a more resilient population – since polyploidy is more common in hybrids, may be important to understand its impacts. I also know polyploidy sometimes happens in corals (especially Caribbean corals), which can reproduce asexually fairly easily. (Need to read related paper Stephens et al. 2023 – w/ Putnam and Bhattacharya!)\n\nA: Since polyploidy reduces breeding potential so could be useful in conservation. But don;t have any information on relationship between polyploidy and methylation or the mechanisms of how polyploidy affects methylation\n\nConfused about a couple aspects of the experimental setup:\n\nStated that lab obtained 500 oysters for the experiment, but then states that the starting sample size of each of the six treatments (2 controls, 2 single stressor, 2 multiple stressors) was 112, which adds to way over 500 oysters\n\nA:\n\nFor the multiple stressors treatment, why was aerial exposure not repeated multiple times (since low tide happens on a regular daily schedule, not just once during a given warming event)?\n\nA: Don’t want to go overboard and kill all the oysters, so start out trying with less stressful stress conditions. Want to understand more than just the death outcome.\n\n\nIn Results, why is survival probability not the direct inverse of mortality?\n\nA: doesn’t know, maybe check supplemental materials or ask in Slack\n\nI think I noticed some typos… do you want to know about them or just leave it be?\n\nPutnam et al. 2023 (Dynamic DNA methylation contributes to carryover effects…)\n\nIn the results section I saw that shell area was used as a proxy for shell size – is it assumed that shell thickness remains fairly constant? Do we know this will hold during acidification? Also, are shell size and body mass tightly correlated? (I would assume so, but it would be interesting if acidic conditions messed with that relationship)\n\nA: Not assumed, but it wasn’t measured. Emma Tidman paper looks at effect of acidification on various measures of shell strength/size.\nA: Emma also looked at body mass/tissue impacts of acidification (but yes, there is generally a correlation between shell size and body mass)\n\nIn Fig.3 I’m a little confused about the y-axes of 3c and 3d – what is the baseline (the “1”) for these relative size values? It doesn’t seem like it could be original size (as in a and b)\n\nA: check supplemental\n\nWhat is the difference between differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs)? Are DMRs just methylation of non-coding DNA (e.g. introns)?\n\nA: Regions are just more broad than genes (so regions could contain genes). The scale (in terms of number of bp) goes loci -&gt; genes -&gt; regions.\n\nI have no idea what’s going on in figure 4 :(\n\nA: each cell represents gene and the z-score is basically showing a heatmap of gene expression. The “tree” looking thing is just showing clustering of individuals based on expression level.\n\nor figure 5\n\nA: Steven is also kind of confused about this rn, but check supplementals for more\n\nWhat are DEGs (pg12)? Also, are CpGs just cytosine/guanine pairs?\n\nDEG=Differentially expressed gene (rather than differentially methylated), and yes, CpGs are cytosine/guanine pairs"

Triploid summer mortality is the big concern, so it would be useful to have some way to “diagnose” stress in the field, informing farms when/how they need to adjust their setups to avoid mass mortality (e.g., adding feed, moving bags to reduce density, shifting to cooler waters, bring into hatchery(?), etc.). Stress “priming” is also a way that hatcheries could preemptively prepare stock for stressful events. Maybe a cool tweak to the project would be to start with diploid/triploid larvae, prime some (but not others), raise to adulthood, and outplant to see how they do in the field. Throughout, measure some set of physiological features (e.g., respiration) to quantify stress and try to develop some assay of biomarkers indicative of stress/impending mortality. Could still do temp and nutrition stress\nI also really like the idea that Sarah suggested about making notebook posts for specific topics when I do a deep dive into the literature on a specific thing, plus her notebook has some really cool features, so I think I’m going to try to implement some of those!"

Probably doesn’t affect end result of kallisto much, since it’s pseudoaligning full reads, but still need to fix it. Should be a straightforward fix, the biggest pain will be waiting another 4 hours for the adjusted transcriptome generation code to run again😭\nDid a quick and dirty test using both a gff and a bed file as input to bedtools getfasta and both resulted in the same output, suggesting bedtools does appropriately differentiate between the formats!

I did see that there’s already a count matrix for A.pulchra linked in the deep dive repo (here), but it’s different to my kallisto output – maybe run using different reference? Isn’t entirely clear, but I think that may be from the lncRNA work, which was using genome reference through HiSat?\nAlso started on process for P.evermanni, but realized that reference data is only available as a CDS gff file, not as a FASTA, and kallisto requires FASTA format to generate an index.

How can you get useful/trustworthy information by comparing your data to itsself…?\n^in effort to make sense of above question I made a quick sketch – I think it’s something like this? I realized that I forgot (for the nth time) that I’m working with RNA now, not DNA, so there are multiple copies of every sequenced transcript, and for DGE work the relative abundances of the transcripts, rather than presence/absence, is what matters.\n\nFeeling very dumb and confused about the minutia of how to do the deep dive gene expression stuff so switched back to a generic DGE pipeline in preparation for the cod samples. Going to use Megan’s clam data (see full discussion of her workhere) as test data to push through my workflow."

We have trimmed RNAseq reads for the three species but we couldn’t find any published transcriptomes. However, for P.meandrina we found NCBI published gff files with only annotated protein-coding genes, which could maybe be used to approximate a transcriptome file? We’re not sure if that work correctly with kallisto though, or if we’d still need to use HiSat…\nRead up on some of the sncRNA tools we used to write up on them in the deep dive manuscript (loving how it takes like 40min of reading to write 1 summary sentence of how something works)."

It wouldn’t work perfectly just subbing in a different list of sequences to current workflow. Star sequences are getting blast hits to the sets of stars associated with already known conserved mature miRNAs, and I’m not exactly sure how I might want to change the filtering to get what I want. After manually investigating it in Google sheets though, it looks like including star sequences wouldn’t have a huge impact. Instead of 4 miRNAs conserved in all three species and 1/1/1 for each pair of species, including stars as possible mature miRNA sequences would shift the conserved counts to 5 miRNAs in all three species and 0/1/1 for the Apul-Peve, Apul-Pmea, and Peve-Pmea pairs."

I expect to spend significantly less time on TAing after this first week, as students require less assistance for basic R tasks, and as the course site requires less setup/maintainance. I should spend more time on classes, particularly FISH315 research, and thesis work."

Raw WGBS FastQs were concatenated, trimmed using fastp, repaired if necessary using BBtools, and the quality-checked using FastQC and MultiQC.\nAlignment. Trimmed WGBS FastQs were aligned to the C. virginica genome using Bismark and Bowtie, then summarized using MultiQC.\nDeduplication. After reads were aligned to the C. virginica genome, they were deduplicated using Bismark to remove read duplication caused by PCR amplification during WGBS.\nMethylation extraction. Bismark was used to call the methylation state of all sequenced cytosine positions.\n\n\nAnalysis\nUsed methylKit to perform differential methylation analysis. All analysis steps were performed on three data subsets: all offspring lifestages in combination; only the zygote samples; and only the larvae samples. This is a preliminary way to account for the possible effects of lifestage on methylation.\nSeveral samples were excluded from differential methylation analysis due to poor data quantity/quality.\nThus far, analysis has only considered differential methylation of CpG sites, which I refer to here as differentially methylated loci (DMLs). Additional work should also consider differentially methylated regions\n\n\nResults\nIn all offspring subsets (combined, zygote only, and larvae only), I identified many DMLs associated with parental treatment (81 in combined analysis, 545 in zygote-only, 1061 in larvae-only).\nMost DMLs occurred in the gene body, with occurrence roughly equally split between intronic and exonic regions.\n\nFor all groups considered (combined, zygote-only, and larvae-only), a small subset of offspring DMLs were also differentially methylated in the parent gonads based on OA exposure. Shared DMLs were almost exclusively found in the male parents. Of the 81 DMLs identified in the combined offspring analysis, 7 sites (8.64%) were also differentially methylated in the male parents (0 in the female parents). Of the 545 DMLs identified in analysis of zygotes alone, 15 (2.75%) were differentially methylated in male parents (0 in female). Finally, in the larvae-only analysis, 31 of the1061 larval DMLs (2.92%) were also differentially methylated in male parents (2 in female parents).\nPlotting the methylation profiles of both parents and offspring, we see a offspring profiles are clearly more similar to male parents, and that both are divergent from female parents. There is not, however, clear grouping by exposure (or parental exposure) to OA treatment."

In this step, kallisto takes your reference transcriptome as input and breaks each transcript into “k-mers,” or shorter sequences that are k nucleotides long. It then “indexes” these k-mers, storing each k-mer and its transcript association in a data structure for more efficient retrieval during the pseudoalignment step.\n\n\nSample quantification\nNext is quantification, which take both the index you just constructed and your trimmed RNAseq read, and makes use of pseudoalignment, a process that is much faster and more efficient than aligning each full read to a full transcript. Briefly, each read is broken up into k-mers, which are then mapped to the index to see which indexed transcript k-mers may match the read k-mers. Kallisto then calculates a probability score for each read/transcript pair, evaluating the likelihood that a given read originated from each transcript. These scores are then used to estimate transcript abundance.\n\n\nBuild count matrix for all samples\nThe kallisto quantification process can only take one sample (i.e., one pair of reads) at a time, so as a last step we build a counts matrix that lists the transcript abundances for all of our samples in a single file.\n\n\nSummary\nA. pulchra:\nsample 140 – 47M reads processed (61.4% mapped)\nsample 145 – 42M reads processed (65.3% mapped)\nsample 150 – 43M reads processed (47.0% mapped)\nsample 173 – 47M reads processed (60.7% mapped)\nsample 178 – 42M reads processed (59.3% mapped)\n\nP. evermanni:\nsample 71 – 50M reads processed (35.3% mapped)\nsample 73 – 51M reads processed (29.8% mapped)\nsample 76 – 49M reads processed (35.6% mapped)\nsample 79 – 49M reads processed (31.9% mapped)\nsample 82 – 48M reads processed (37.3% mapped)\nP. meandrina:\nsample 47 – 54M reads processed (26.1% mapped)\nsample 48 – 51M reads processed (25.3% mapped)\nsample 50 – 55M reads processed (31.1% mapped)\nsample 53 – 53M reads processed (31.8% mapped)\nsample 57 – 42M reads processed (21.7% mapped)"

    "title": "ShortStack: mature vs. star sequences incorrect?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "See E5 deep-dive Github issue #49\nWhile looking at ShortStack database matches, for the three species I realized that all three have matches to multiple published sequences of miR-2030, but miR-2030 was not one of the miRNAs identified as conserved between the three species. After poking around I realized that the Apul miR-2030 miRNA and Peve miR-2030 have identical mature miRNA sequences, but the Pmea miR-2030 has a totally different mature sequence. Instead, the star sequence of Pmea miR-2030 matches the mature sequences for Apul miR-2030 and Peve miR-2030. This raises the possibility that ShortStack is incorrectly distinguishing between mature and star sequences, which would throw a bit of a wrench in the current workflow to identify conserved miRNAs. I also noted something similar when comparing ShortStack outputs to the miRdeep2 output.\n\n\nAs a reminder, miRNAs originate as primary miRNA transcripts (“pri-miRNAs”) transcribed from genes, which are characteristically folded in a “hairpin” structure. These pri-miRNAs are then cleaved at their base to form precursor miRNAs (“pre-miRNAs”). The pre-miRNA loop is then removed by Dicer, leaving a mature miRNA duplex. Both of these strands (5’ and 3’) can be loaded into an Argonaute (AGO) protein complex to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which then guides gene expression. However, one strand is usually preferentially loaded, in part based on its thermodynamic stability. Strands that are not loaded are unwound from their complement and generally degraded by cellular machinery. The preferentially-loaded strand is commonly titled the “mature miRNA,” while the unloaded strand is commonly called the “miRNA*” or “miRNA star”. Since the AGO-loaded strand (mature miRNA) is the one that actually influences gene expression, this is the strand that is considered important during miRNA identification and analysis. (Summarized from (O’Brien et al. 2018))\n\n\n\nmiRNA biogenisis (Tomari and Zamore 2005)\n\n\nIt isn’t entirely clear from the ShortStack documentation how it distinguishes between mature and star sequences. What sequence features would indicate one strand is more likely to be loaded on to the RISC complex than the other? In addition, O’Brien et al. (2018) seem to suggest that both the mature and star miRNA molecules could play some role in gene expression – does that mean we should be considering both to be important?\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nO’Brien, Jacob, Heyam Hayder, Yara Zayed, and Chun Peng. 2018. “Overview of MicroRNA Biogenesis, Mechanisms of Actions, and Circulation.” Frontiers in Endocrinology 9 (August): 402. https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2018.00402.\n\n\nTomari, Yukihide, and Phillip D.

Normalized counts are most useful for things like visualizing expression levels and differential expression analysis.\nVariance stabilization aims to make the variance of the transformed data approximately independent of the mean, reducing heteroscedasticity (the relationship between variance and mean) and “smoothing” out the variance at low counts. Notably, the transformed data is no longer on the original count scale. The transformation makes the variance roughly constant across the range of counts, which makes it easier to interpret patterns in the data visually. Variance stabilized data is most useful for exploratory data analysis, like PCA, clustering, and heatmaps, and is also the transformation we’ll want to use before WGCNA.\nHere’s some of the figures generated in these summary docs"

Normalized counts are most useful for things like visualizing expression levels and differential expression analysis.\nSecond is variance stabilizing the counts data, which aims to make the variance of the transformed data approximately independent of the mean, reducing heteroscedasticity (the relationship between variance and mean) and “smoothing” out the variance at low counts. Notably, the transformed data is no longer on the original count scale. The transformation makes the variance roughly constant across the range of counts, which makes it easier to interpret patterns in the data visually. Variance stabilized data is most useful for exploratory data analysis, like PCA, clustering, and heatmaps, and is also the transformation we’ll want to use before WGCNA.\n\n# extract normalized counts # (normalization is automatically performed by deseq2) Apul_counts_RNA_norm &lt;- counts(dds_Apul_RNA, normalized=TRUE) %&gt;% data.frame()  write.table(Apul_counts_RNA_norm, file = \"../output/03.01-Apul-RNA-summary-Hisat/Apul_counts_RNA_normalized.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE, quote = FALSE)   # variance stabilized data vsd_Apul_RNA &lt;- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds_Apul_RNA, blind=TRUE) wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA &lt;- getVarianceStabilizedData(dds_Apul_RNA) rv_wpn_Apul_RNA &lt;- rowVars(wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA, useNames=TRUE)  Apul_counts_RNA_vsd &lt;- data.frame(wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA) write.table(Apul_counts_RNA_vsd, file = \"../output/03.01-Apul-RNA-summary-Hisat/Apul_counts_RNA_variancestabilized.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE,quote = FALSE)  q75_wpn_Apul_RNA &lt;- quantile(rowVars(wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA, useNames=TRUE), .75)  # 75th quantile variability Apul_counts_RNA_vsd_q75 &lt;- wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA[ rv_wpn_Apul_RNA &gt; q75_wpn_Apul_RNA, ] %&gt;% data.frame # filter to retain only the most variable genes write.table(Apul_counts_RNA_vsd_q75, file = \"../output/03.01-Apul-RNA-summary-Hisat/Apul_counts_RNA_variancestabilized_q75.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE,quote = FALSE)  q95_wpn_Apul_RNA &lt;- quantile(rowVars(wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA, useNames=TRUE), .95)  # 95th quantile variability Apul_counts_RNA_vsd_q95 &lt;- wpn_vsd_Apul_RNA[ rv_wpn_Apul_RNA &gt; q95_wpn_Apul_RNA, ] %&gt;% data.frame # filter to retain only the most variable genes write.table(Apul_counts_RNA_vsd_q95, file = \"../output/03.01-Apul-RNA-summary-Hisat/Apul_counts_RNA_variancestabilized_q95.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE,quote = FALSE)"

For example, FUN_026128 was well-predicted by just a couple of lncRNA, which was potentially very interesting.\n\nHowever, upon plotting the expression, we see the gene is just invariant over time, and was “predicted by” other largely invariant features."

Was there a cutoff for minimum total bp shared?\n\n\n\n^Looks like Jill only used the miRanda settings -e -20 and -strict, while I used -e -20, -sc 100, and -strict. The -sc is a score cutoff. It may not have affected results, since a brief check suggested the energy cutoff (-e -20) was more stringent and implicitly restricted results to scores above 100. However, I should add a manual filter when using Jill’s miRanda outputs (miRNA-3UTR) to be safe.\nWe also have topGO enrichment of significant miRNA-mRNA interactions if we want to use them"

So far they haven’t seen any direct effect on the anemone host or anemone fertility/reproduction, which we might normally expect based on role of estrogen in vertebrates. There was, however, a significant effect on the symbiont populations – in presence of estrogen, symbionts were increasingly photosynthetically efficient – woah! The effect was so strong that they could actually see differences in the color of the water the anemones were held in because of increased levels of algae in the water. Increasing estrogen levels led to this gradient of increasingly green water 😮. Also touched on studying impact of sediment suspension (affects symbiont productivity and/or polyp feeding?)\nWe also talked a bit about the possibility of coral polyps in the same aggregate colony sharing the “symbiont load,” and related nutrients, which could explain when some species have “patchy” symbiont distribution around colony. Apparently there’s a kind of plant that grows in/near salty water and, to rid itself of excess salt, basically picks a leaf to die and sends all the salt there, leaving the rest of the plant healthy. Maybe similar stuff happens in corals?"

    "text": "SICB Day 5\nThe importance of life history strategies in the recovery of corals after thermal stress (Jacqueline Padilla-Gamino)\n\nSuper interesting idea! Basically, maybe the combination of MHW and differing egg/sperm developmental timelines are causing egg/sperm mismatch when spawning happens!\nEggs take a long time to develop and start in late summer, and thus are already in development during MHW/bleaching events. Sperm, however, as “cheap” and don’t start developing until March, so never experience bleaching before the spawning season in early summer. That means that, during spawning, you can end up with bleaching-affected eggs trying to match with unstressed sperm – maybe that “mismatch” is causing problems!\nBred bleached (B) and non-bleached (NB) corals. Found that BxB corals and NBxNB corals were most successful in larval development, while BxNB and NBxB corals didn’t do as well. Support for this possible mismatch problem\nWhile I’m sure this is at least partially because of bleaching-related stress effects of the viability of the eggs or something similar, this is making me think about the possible role of epigenetics here. We know that environmental conditions can be associated with epigenetic modifications like methylation, and that such epigenetic modifications can also take place in the gametes and thus become heritable. Is it possible that there are epigenetic modifications happening in the eggs during these bleaching events that are not happening to the sperm, and that this “mismatch” of the epigenome is less successful that the combination of two stress-modified gametes (BxB) or of two non-modified gametes (NBxNB)?\n\nAssessing physiological and molecular plasticity in the early stages of Porites astreoides (Florence Fields)\nIntraspecific variation in thermal tolerance in the endangered Caribbean coral, Acropora palmata (Holland Elder)\n\nKeep in mind bleaching, like other stress reponses, is continuous, not binary!\n\nThe butterfly(fish) effect: Using Caetodontidae territories as bioindicators (Corrine Avidan)\nMicrobial predictors of bleacing in Great Barrier Reef Acropora millepora (Karim Primov)\nIron wars over ligand soup: Exploring chemical crosstalk in Symbiodiniaceae-bacteria interactions (Hannah Reich)\n\nBacteria can help eukaryotic partners (like algae) access hard-to-get iron\nPossible connection here to Callum’s talk about impacts of heavy metal contamination on coral/holobiont?\n\nEnvironmental drivers of coral-associated algal and microbial communities across multiple scales (Coleen Bove)"

How would it differ among sexual reproduction and the many forms of asexual reproduction?\nHeritability of ncRNA-related epigenetic changes?\nWhile reading George et al. 2023, I noticed they used heat shock to induce triploidy in their Pacific oysters (referenced Yamamoto et al. 1988, which showed you can apply a heat shock of 35*C to 20*C-acclimated larvae during meiosis to induce triploidy). Raised the question of whether this can/does happen in the wild? And if it’s possible to achieve triploidy-inducing heat shock conditions in the wild, does that mean that climate change/increased incidence of MHW will begin shifting wild oyster populations to more triploids, and thus affect fertility/reproductive viability of wild pops?\nA common way of producing triploid oyster stocks nowadays is crossing tetraploid and diploid oysters (genertes 100% triploid offspring without the mortality associated with heat-shock or chemically induced triploidy). We know that induced-triploids are less robust to temperature/aerial exposure stress than diploids (George et al. 2023). Is it possible that, in induced triploids, the heat/chemical shock at an early life stage epigenetically “primes” them poorly? Epigenetic modifications and genetic adaptations to stress are heritable, though, so how do tetraploidXdiploid triploids fare under stress conditions, and can this be modulated by the acclimation/adaptation of the parents?\nDuring some preliminary lit review on Pacific cod and MHW related mortality, I read that overall warming and early-year MHWs can affect the timing of marine primary production (e.g. phytoplankton reproduction and abundance). Oysters feed on phytoplankton through filter feeding – does that mean that, as oceans warm, oysters may be facing more starvation stress? Especially if there ends up being a “mismatch” of spawning and primary production?\nDoes polyploidy affect the way you analyze and compare gene expression data? Since a triploid would have an extra set of chromosomes, could that affect number of transcripts even if [# transcripts expressed per chromosome] didnt change?"

I’m still in the early stages of my projects, so it’s difficult to know exactly which papers might be useful for future project planning, lit reviews, writing, etc. I recently started using a new method to organize all of my papers, so I thought I’d share!\n\nStep 1: Zotero\nI started using the reference manager Zotero in December and I really like being able to annotate papers, generate notes, and assign tags. My workflow when I find a new paper I’m interested in is to first read the abstract, add the paper to my Zotero library, and assign tags related to how I might plan on using the paper (e.g. species name, relevant methods) . I also always assign the tag “unread,” and then change it to “read” once I’ve finished reading/annotating.\nHowever, Zotero doesn’t have an easy way to view the tags, notes, or some types of metadata associated with multiple papers at the same time. Since I’m a very visual person, I want a way to view, sort, and search the key information from all of my papers at the same time. After asking for suggestions in the lab Slack, Chris sent me a Sheets template that I’ve been testing out!\n\n\nStep 2: Google Sheets\nOriginal template (from Chris)\nMy current document\nMy current setup for this document looks like this:\n\n\nThe metadata recorded in the Sheets document is a little redundant because all of my papers are already stored in my Zotero library, but it ensures I’m recording information for the right paper.\nHere’s a look at all of the options for the different categorical variables:\n\n\nWith these options I can search by project, study type, and relevance, and keep track of how thoroughly I’ve read a source in my library.\nI’m still in the early stages of implementing this document, but so far I really like it! While I was brainstorming the oyster project experimental design I had to reference a few papers and the Sheets document made it much easier to quickly go through many papers and the information I’d identified as most helpful, without having to individually click on each paper to view its associated metadata/notes. I still need to transfer everything i currently have in my Zotero library to the Sheets doc, but I think having this system in place before I really get into the weeds of reading dozens/hundreds of papers for thesis writing will be super helpful!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Literature review on DNA methylation mapping of historical DNA (hDNA), collected from museum specimens. Prepping for SIFP proposal to work with Andrea Quattrini at the Smithsonian NMNH.\n\nWhat is hDNA?\nRaxworthy and Smith (2021) define historical DNA (hDNA) as “the DNA fortuitously contained in the tissues of traditional voucher specimens that are stored in museums and herbaria,” usually &lt;200 years old. Importantly, this is distinguished from ancient DNA (aDNA), which is “DNA recovered from organic material (e.g., bone, plant matter, environmental samples, and subfossils) that is preserved under natural conditions” and is often much older, more degraded, and lower quantity than hDNA. It is also distinguished from tissues collected expressly as DNA samples (and their extracts), which Raxworthy and Smith term “modern DNA.”\nFor the purposes of this proposal, hDNA would potentially be collected from dried and liquid-stored coral specimens, preferably those collected ≥100 year ago. This age preference has two reasonings. First, beginning in the early 1900s many museum specimens were “fixed” (preserved as fluid voucher specimens) in formalin, a formaldehyde solution, which we now know presents many complications for DNA work. Second, for this project the value of museum archives lies in their collections of specimens that predate the serious impacts of anthropogenic climate change and environmental disturbance. Older specimens will yield epigenomes more useful for comparison to those of modern counterparts.\n\n\n\nRaxworthy and Smith (2021)\n\n\n\n\nChallenges of working with hDNA\nThere are a lot of challenges to working with hDNA in general.\n\nContamination\nContamination with exogenous DNA (from an organism other than the specimen itself) can happen at any point during the collection, processing, transport, storage, or additional handling of the specimen.\n\n\nDNA degradation\nBoth dry- and wet-stored specimens stored at room temperature gradually lose high molecular weight DNA and overall DNA quantity over time. In addition, specimens stored in alcohol can suffer hydrolytic damage if alcohol concentration drops due to evaporative loss (which is a universal problem for large collections). For fixed specimens, formalin can cause cross-linkages between DNA and other protein/DNA molecules and cause increased DNA damage like deamination and depurination. (Raxworthy and Smith (2021))\n\n\nCytosine deamination\nParticularly relevant to this proposed project, DNA also undergoes cytosine deamination overtime. This is a spontaneous process in which cytosine residues are converted into uracil or hydroxyuracil. These are then observed as C-T and G-A transitions when deaminated cytosines are incorporated into a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Notably, while “unmethylated cytosines are deaminated into uracils, causing CpG → UpG modifications; methylated cytosines, on the other hand, are deaminated into thymines at a faster pace, which results in CpG → TpG patterns.” (Niiranen et al. (2022))\nThis is super important in the consideration of hDNA for DNA methylation work, because the methods we use to map DNA methylation also use a CpG → UpG modification. The most common tool used to map DNA methylation is Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), which converts unmethylated cytosines into uracils, which are then sequenced as thymine (CpG → UpG → TpG). Remaining CpGs represent the methylated cytosines of the original sequence. That means deaminated cytosines, either methylated or unmethylated, would appear to be unmethylated following WGBS since all deaminated cytosines would ultimately be sequenced as TpG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat is the timescale of cytosine deamination? Would specimens 100-200 years old have experienced sufficient cytosine deamination to significantly affect methylation mapping? How does the answer to this vary across preservation mediums (dry, alcohol, formalin)?\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious methylation work using hDNA\nI’ve only found one paper so far that has trialed hDNA methylation mapping, and the authors also conclude they are the only example (at the time of publishing, in 2019).\nRubi, Knowles, and Dantzer (2020)\n\n75 specimens of mice (40 white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis) and 35 woodland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis))\ntraditional museum skull preparations (dried skulls stored at room temperature)\nCollected in same locality in Menominee county, Michigan, over three collecting periods spanning 76 years (1940, 2003, and 2013–2016)\n\n\n\n\nRaxworthy and Smith (2021)\n\n\n\nFor the older specimens (13yo and 76yo), improved sequencing results decreased quickly past 5X read depth. In other words, while 5X depthwas a big improvement on 1X, 10X depth was not much different from 5X. This suggests that higher sequencing depth is important when working with old material, but has diminishing returns.\nInterestingly, while the youngest specimens (0-3yo) yielded much higher global methylation rates than the older groups (13yo and 76yo), the two older groups did not have significantly different global methylation rates. So while new material is much more successful, past ~10 years all older material has similar global methylation rates?\nRegional methylation patterns did not differ significantly due to specimen age\nThere was no notable signal of read end deamination. However, this may be the result of including a double digestion step, which cleaves DNA at both ends and may have “cut off” the more highly deaminated read ends. The slightly reduced global methylation rate of the 76yo group, in comparison to the 0-3 yo group, may indicate cytosine deamination in the oldest group.\nRecommends steps to reduce sequencing of deaminated sites (e.g. a double-digestions step, as included in this study, or uracil-DNA-glycosylase and endonuclease VIII, which can be used to remove uracils prior to bisulfite treatment, preventing the sequencing of unmethylated cystosines that have been deaminated into uracil)\nRecommendations for increasing yield from historic specimens:\n\nReduce size selection window to compensate for DNA fragmentation. Note that, while selecting smaller fragments would increase yield, it may also reduce the number of homologous loci sequenced across individuals, which may reduce ability to compare methylation patterns if sample size is low.\nSteps to minimize DNA degradation during bisulfite treatment, e.g. shortening bisulfite incubation time. Note, however, that this could also reduce conversion efficiency.\nCould remove the double digestion step, as this may have contributed to DNA fragmentation issues. Note, however, that this may lead to more issues with read-end deamination signal, as discussed above\n\n\n\n\nMethods for DNA methylation mapping\nChatGPT Summary:\nHere’s a comparison of different methylation mapping tools/methods based on cost, suitability for degraded/low-quantity DNA, use with partial cytosine deamination, and how established the method is:\n\nWhole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS)\n\nCost: High. WGBS sequences the entire genome after bisulfite treatment, making it the most expensive option due to the amount of sequencing required.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: Less suited for highly degraded DNA or very low quantities due to the need for large amounts of starting material and good quality DNA.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: WGBS relies on bisulfite treatment, which deaminates unmethylated cytosines to uracil (later read as thymine). Partial deamination could lead to incomplete conversion, impacting accuracy.\nHow well established: Very well established. WGBS is considered the gold standard for methylome analysis, providing comprehensive genome-wide methylation data.\n\n\n\nTargeted Bisulfite Sequencing (Targeted BS)\n\nCost: Moderate to high, depending on the number of regions targeted. It is more cost-effective than WGBS since only specific regions are sequenced.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: Better suited for degraded or low-quantity DNA compared to WGBS because it focuses on specific regions, requiring less input material.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: Similar to WGBS, it relies on bisulfite conversion, so incomplete conversion can affect results. However, focusing on smaller regions may allow more control and validation of conversion efficiency.\nHow well established: Well established. Targeted BS is widely used for focused methylation studies, especially in candidate regions like promoters or CpG islands.\n\n\n\nEnzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-Seq)\n\nCost: Moderate. EM-Seq offers a more cost-effective alternative to WGBS with a similar level of genomic coverage but without bisulfite treatment.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: More suitable than WGBS for degraded or low-quantity DNA because it uses an enzyme-based approach that is gentler than harsh bisulfite treatment.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: EM-Seq avoids bisulfite-induced cytosine deamination by using enzymatic conversion, making it ideal when bisulfite’s harsh chemical treatment might cause issues, including incomplete conversion.\nHow well established: Relatively new. EM-Seq is a promising alternative to bisulfite-based methods but is not yet as widely adopted as WGBS or Targeted BS.\n\n\n\nTarget Enriched EM-Seq\n\nCost: Moderate, less than WGBS but more than basic bisulfite methods.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: More suited for degraded DNA since the enzyme-based method is gentler.\nPartial cytosine deamination: Avoids bisulfite-induced damage, reducing errors tied to incomplete deamination.\nHow established: New but growing in popularity as an alternative to bisulfite sequencing, especially for focused regions.\n\n\n\nUracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG) Treatment\n\nCost: Variable, typically added on to bisulfite sequencing workflows (e.g., WGBS or Targeted BS).\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: UDG treatment is part of a preprocessing step to improve the accuracy of bisulfite sequencing but does not make it inherently better for degraded/low-quantity DNA.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: UDG treatment improves bisulfite sequencing by removing uracils generated from deaminated cytosines, which helps prevent errors from cytosine deamination that occur before bisulfite treatment. This leads to more accurate differentiation between methylated and unmethylated cytosines.\nHow well established: Well established, but UDG treatment is typically used in combination with other methods (e.g., WGBS) to improve accuracy rather than being a standalone method.\n\n\n\nMethylation-Sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (MS-AFLP)\n\nCost: Low to moderate. MS-AFLP is a more affordable technique compared to sequencing-based approaches.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: More suitable for degraded or low-quantity DNA, as it is based on PCR amplification and restriction digestion, which requires less starting material than sequencing-based approaches.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: MS-AFLP does not use bisulfite treatment, so partial deamination is not an issue. However, it depends on restriction enzymes sensitive to methylation status, so results can be impacted by incomplete digestion.\nHow well established: Long established but less widely used in high-resolution methylation studies compared to sequencing methods like WGBS. It’s an older method useful for specific applications, such as detecting overall methylation patterns or comparing methylation between samples.\n\n\n\nMethylated CpG Binding Domain Sequencing (MBD-seq)\n\nCost: Moderate. MBD-seq involves selective enrichment of methylated DNA, followed by sequencing, making it less expensive than whole-genome methods like WGBS but potentially more expensive than targeted approaches depending on the depth of sequencing required.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: More tolerant of low-quantity DNA than WGBS, but highly degraded DNA can be problematic, as larger fragments are better for efficient methylated DNA capture.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: Not impacted by cytosine deamination because MBD-seq relies on binding to methylated CpG sites via a protein domain, not on chemical conversion. This makes it more robust when bisulfite-induced errors might be an issue.\nHow well established: Well established, though less commonly used than bisulfite sequencing-based methods like WGBS. MBD-seq is often used for cost-effective, genome-wide methylation profiling without full bisulfite sequencing.\n\n\n\nMethylRAD\n\nCost: Low to moderate. MethylRAD uses methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to digest and sequence methylated DNA regions, making it more cost-effective than sequencing-based approaches that require bisulfite conversion or whole-genome coverage.\nUse with degraded/low-quantity DNA: Suitable for low-quantity DNA because it relies on restriction digestion and PCR amplification, but highly degraded DNA may still cause issues if fragments are too short to be efficiently digested.\nUse with partial cytosine deamination: Not affected by cytosine deamination since MethylRAD does not use bisulfite treatment. Instead, it depends on restriction enzyme sensitivity to methylation, so it avoids issues related to incomplete bisulfite conversion.\nHow well established: Relatively new but gaining traction. It’s not as widely adopted as WGBS but is becoming a popular, cost-effective alternative for methylation analysis, particularly for comparative methylation studies.\n\n\n\nComparison Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nCost\nDegraded/Low-Quantity DNA\nPartial Cytosine Deamination\nHow Established\n\n\n\n\nWGBS\nHigh\nLess suitable\nSensitive to incomplete conversion\nGold standard, very well established\n\n\nTargeted BS\nModerate\nBetter suited\nSensitive to incomplete conversion\nWell established\n\n\nEM-Seq\nModerate\nSuitable\nAvoids bisulfite-induced damage\nNewer, gaining popularity\n\n\nTarget Enriched EM-Seq\nModerate\nSuitable\nAvoids bisulfite-induced damage\nNewer, promising\n\n\nUDG Treatment (w/BS)\nVariable\nNeutral impact\nImproves bisulfite accuracy\nWell established with WGBS\n\n\nMS-AFLP\nLow/Moderate\nSuitable\nNot impacted by deamination\nOlder, less common\n\n\nMBD-seq\nModerate\nSuitable for low-quantity, less for degraded\nNot impacted\nWell established but less common\n\n\nMethylRAD\nLow/Moderate\nSuitable, but not ideal for highly degraded DNA\nNot impacted\nNewer, cost-effective, growing\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nCost: WGBS remains the most expensive method, while MethylRAD and MS-AFLP are among the least expensive. MBD-seq is a mid-range option that provides genome-wide methylation information without full sequencing.\nDegraded/low-quantity DNA: MethylRAD and MBD-seq handle low-quantity DNA better than WGBS, but highly degraded samples may still present challenges for both.\nPartial cytosine deamination: MBD-seq and MethylRAD are unaffected by partial cytosine deamination because they don’t rely on bisulfite conversion.\nHow established: WGBS is the gold standard, while MBD-seq is a well-established alternative for methylation profiling. MethylRAD is newer but growing in popularity due to its cost-effectiveness and potential for comparative studies.\n\n\n\n\nNanopore Sequencing\nAn option that Steven mentioned as potentially useful is Nanopore sequencing. In this method, DNA (or RNA) molecules are fed through a nanopore, a tiny hole embedded in a membrane that separates two chambers of electrolyte solution. When a voltage is applied, an enzyme pushes the DNA molecule through the nanopore and fluctuations in the electric current are tracked. Specialized software can then be used to assign nucleotide at each position based on the current fluctuations.\nWhile Nanopore sequencing was originally developed for standard DNA sequencing, softwares have been developed that can interpret Nanopore read data to identify methylated nucleotides (e.g., Ahsan et al. (2024)). This has many advantages over WGBS that could be really useful for working with hDNA.\nAs a reminder, the biggest hurdles when working with hDNA are likely to be 1) low DNA quantity, and 2) low DNA quality, including spontaneous cytosine deamination that converts CpG sites to either UpGs (unmethylated) or TpGs (methylated). Nanopore sequencing reads and detects nucleotides from a single DNA molecule at a time, meaning it works with much lower quantities of DNA than traditional sequencing methods. This also means that DNA amplification (i.e., PCR) is not required, so there are no biases introduced prior to sequencing. In addition, since Nanopore sequencing requires no modification of the DNA (e.g., bisulfite conversion), there is no introduced deamination, meaning deaminated cytosines will not be confused with intact methylated and unmethylated cytosines. Finally, as the cherry on top, Oxford Nanopore Technologies announced just a few months ago that they now have “the ability to detect damaged DNA bases, including genomic Uracil (dU) at 96.34% accuracy.” This means that, not only will Nanopore sequencing distinguish between intact and deaminated cytosines, it should be able to differentiate between deaminated cytosines (deaminated CpG → UpG) and deaminated methylated cytosines (CpG → TpG)!\nI couldn’t find a description of the analysis changes that allow ONT to detect damaged DNA, but if that update is not yet publicly available, I also found a paper describing how to detect Uracil in DNA Békési et al. (2021), which would similarly allow you to discriminate cytosine deamination of methylated and unmethylated cytosine.\n\n\nNotes for SIFP project:\n\nIf I’m trying to do a validation-type paper, which might hold the most water given how little hDNA methylation work has been done, would be best to use specimens of same species, collected from same location over multiple time points (ideally same reef).\nSeems like big concerns are dealing with fragmented DNA and cytosine deamination. EM-Seq seems like the best option for addressing both of those, and it may be abit cheaper than WGBS! Only downside is that it’s not as well established, so I’m not sure how that might affect data analysis (are there existing tools?) or reporting/interpreting results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAhsan, Mian Umair, Anagha Gouru, Joe Chan, Wanding Zhou, and Kai Wang. 2024. “A Signal Processing and Deep Learning Framework for Methylation Detection Using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing.” Nature Communications 15 (1): 1448. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45778-y.\n\n\nBékési, Angéla, Eszter Holub, Hajnalka Laura Pálinkás, and Beáta G.

See raw data in the “Notebook photos” section, and digitally entered data here.\n\n\nClearance rate trials\n\nTrial 3\nAnother round of clearance rate trials. This time I wanted to try oysters at a range of sizes. Selected 3 oysters of a range of sizes from both the “13” diploid cohort and the “Bird” triploid cohort (untreated). Placed each oyster in 700mL of algae-rich seawater (sourced from black tub and diluted until algae content was just below the quantifiable level of 199 ug/L using the FluoroSense fluorometer). Monitored for ~1hr at roughly 10min intervals. Took triplicate fluorometer readings each time.\nSee data entered here, or original data in the below notebook photos.\n\n\n\nNote: values shown are the third of each set of triplicate measurements from each time point (column “Fluoro3” in the raw datasheet)\n\n\nAs expected, the small oysters (13 26mm and Bird 24mm) have a much lower clearance rate. Interestingly though, all of the larger oysters (13 75mm, 13 88mm, Bird 61mm, and Bird 76mm) see to have pretty similar clearance rates, with the Bird 61mm oyster actually beating the others at most time points!\n\n\n\nTrial 3 oysters. “Bird” triploid untreated (top) and “13” diploid untreated (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial 3 setup\n\n\nOverall, since the fluorometer is non-invasive and very easy to use, it seems like the best option may just be to measure clearance rate of the full cohorts (i.e. place the full treatment bags in algae-rich water and monitor feeding). The oysters don’t always open to feed and the fluorometer doesn’t seem sensitive/consistent enough to use with smaller sample sizes.\nUnfortunately the FluoroSense fluorometer stopped working at roughly 15:15. It’s only displaying 0 readings, even for my control solution which was consistently reading at ~180 and was visibly clouded with algae. Matt and I tried recalibrating the fluorometer using the 800ppb Rhodamine calibration solution, but saw no change. There’s no visible damage, the display is functioning normally, and the blue fluorescence light is still working as usual, so I’m really not sure what the issue is :(\n\n\n\nNotebook photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUcar/ferry reciepts"

    "text": "Second trial of an extreme stress test on our extra Pacific oysters. The experimental setup of Trial 1 didn’t work well, and ended up stress the oysters at the sublethal35-38C, instead of a lethal temp of 43C.\nThis time I’ll be using full bucket of water with a heater + thermostat, instead of warming water in the incubator. This should heat the water faster and better regulate the temperature following addition of oysters.\n\nTrial 2 protocol\n\nFilled two clean white plastic buckets with roughly 20L of seawater from the cold seawater tank in FTR. Placed digital thermostats and thermometers in both. To one bucket (the “treatment” bucket), added a rod heater decoupled from the thermostat. Heated the treatment bucket to 43C by manually monitoring the temperature and turning off heater once at temperature.\nNotes: I noticed while heating the treatment bucket that water at the top of the bucket warmed faster than water at the bottom. I added an additional thermostat so that one thermostat sensor was attached to the bottom of the bucket and one was attached the top of the bucket (see pictures). To ensure even heating, I manually mixed the water during heating until the two thermostats were within 1C of each other, repeating whenever the thermostats diverged by more than 1C. Whenever I mixed the treatment bucket, I would also mix the control bucket.\n\n\nIsolated two groups of 10 oysters from bag “13” (untreated diploid), selecting similarly sized sets of oysters, and placed in small mesh bags. Randomly assigned one bag to treatment and one to control. Labelled each with a labelled 15mL tube placed inside bag and colored zip ties attached to the bag (didn’t have any waterproof bag tags). Yellow and black is 43C group, blue and black is control. Measured length of each oyster in each group using a manual caliper, then placed back in respective labelled bags and placed bags in cold seawater tank for roughly 1hr\nNotes: Noticed a few dead oysters in the source bag “13”, all on the small side.\n\n\n\nOnce the treatment seawater bucket was at 43C, I began the stress trial. I placed the “treatment” bag of oysters in the 43C bucket, and the “control” bag of oysters in the bucket of ambient water (roughly 17C). The oysters remained in their respective buckets for 1 hr (16:30 - 17:30, 7/15/2024).\nI maintained the treatment water temperature of 43C by manually monitoring the thermostats and thermometer. When any of these temperature gauges dropped below 42C (a 1C variation) I turned the heater back on until all three temperature gauges were again at 43C. I also mixed the water the entire time the heater was on, to ensure even heating, and ensured the bag of oysters was not touching the heating element itself. I had to turn the heater on roughly every 15 minutes to maintain temperature.\nNotes: The thermostat whose sensor was at the top of the treatment bucket consistently displayed a temperature 1C below the thermostat placed at the bottom of the bucket. I’m not sure if this is because the top layer of water lost heat faster or because of a calibration difference in the thermostats. This means, however, that a drop below 42C in the top thermostat generally meant a drop to 42C in the bottom of the bucket, which means water at the bottom of the bucket likely never dropped below 42C.\nAfter the 1hr treatment, placed both bags of oysters back in the cold seawater tank in FTR.\nUnplugged all heaters and thermostats, emptied both buckets of seawater into the drains in the seawater room, and rinsed both with DI water.\nMonitor oysters in both groups for mortality once per day at roughly noon for the next 2 weeks. To check mortality, remove bag of oysters from tank, empty bag onto table. An empty shell or gaping with no response to stimulation (prodding with metal tool) indicates mortality.\n\n\n\nMortality\nChecked bags daily at roughly noon for mortality. Mortality evaluated by prodding oysters and squeezing lightly at base of hinge. Empty shells or oysters that gaped and remained open during stimulation were considered dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTime\nControl (mm length of dead oyster(s))\nExtreme stress (mm length of dead oyster(s))\n\n\n\n\n7/16\n12:30\n-\n25, 27\n\n\n7/17\n\n\n\n\n\n7/18\n\n\n\n\n\n7/19\n\n\n\n\n\n7/20"

See pictures below. After talking with Ariana we decided they’re probably just an odd type of tunicate. I rubbed off as much as I could, but I noted there do seem to be tiny holes left below where the dots were. Put the oysters back in the left FTR seawater tank.\n\n\n\n\nDissecting a dip/trip\nMy hardening experiment oysters are a wide range of sizes, so it’s likely I’ll be able to take more detailed tissue samples (e.g., specific tissue types, multiple samples from the same tissue). I want to open a larger oyster to see the anatomy clearly and get a sense of where everything is. I also want to check the reproductive maturity of some oysters from the hatchery.\nTo do this, pulled a large untreated diploid (bag “13”) and large untreated triploid (bag “Bird - Extra”) for dissection.\n\nDiploid\n\nNo developed gonad in the diploid\n\n\n\nThe diploid had some serious shell deterioration, particularly around the hinge. Looks to be the work of some kind of boring parasite that left the shell riddled with orange-something filled holes. The shell broke very easily and separated into layers. Notably, there was no obvious sign of this deterioration on the exterior of the shell.\nTook a look at some of the orange substance under the scope:\n\n\n\n\nTriploid\n\nThe triploid had a developed gonad!\n\n\nTook a gamete sample and examined under the scope:\n\nIt’s female! The eggs seem viable but underdeveloped – many have a vaguely tear-drop shape, rather than a filled-out circle.\nThis is just one diploid and triploid, but it’s interesting that the triploid is the only one with gametes. This could either mean that (a) the “Bird” oysters are not actually triploids, or (b) this is a case of a triploid not actually being sterile. Even though triploids are touted as being sterile, I’ve actually read a few papers noting triploids developing gametes in the field and, relevantly, triploid mortality being associated with fecund triploids!

Then placed each oyster in an appropriately sized container. Want to maintain a roughly 1:5 oyster to water volume ratio (1:4 was insufficient to cover some of the heavily cupped oysters), so each container needed to hold at least 6x the oyster volume. Used mix of plastic cups with lids and glass graduated cylinders of several sizes to hold all oysters.\nFilled each cup with seawater of the appropriate temperature (20C or 42C), maintaining a 1:5 oyster:water volume ratio. I also set a minimum water volume of 15mL to ensure the smaller oysters were still fully covered. Filled cups in random order, placing 42C cups in the 42C incubator once filled. 20C cups were left on countertop. Filling took ~30min.\nOnce all cups were filled, began the survivorship test. Checked all cups for mortality every hour. Ended test at 5hours, after roughly 30% of stressed oysters had died.\nRemoved all oysters from 42C incubator. Replaced the water in all cups with 20C seawater, filling to a 1:6 volume ratio to reduce risk of hypoxia during recovery.\nChecked for mortality in all oysters daily, and replaced all oysters’ water with fresh 20C seawater daily. Note that no food is added to seawater, so last time these oysters were fed was Aug. 6, during their recovery from survivorship round 1."

    "text": "Update 8/22\nAs of 8/22 we’re sitting at roughly 50% mortality in the round 2 stressed oysters and roughly 10% mortality in the controls. Interestingly, while there doesn’t appear to be any difference among the original hardening groups, the round 1 survivorship does seem to have had a hardening effect!\nSeveral possible explanations for this observation:\n\nThe original hardening did have an effect, but it was too subtle to see with our reduced sample sizes\nThe original hardening was too long ago – it’s effects were short-term and are no longer manifest, 4 weeks later\nThe original hardening was performed at too low a temperature to see an effect at 42C stress. The original hardening was done at 35C, while survivorship round 1 was at 42C, the same temperature the oysters then experienced during this survivorship round. My brief review of other papers that attempted hardening in bivalves did suggest that hardening was most effective when conditions were similar to those the organism would experience during an extreme stress event post-hardening.\n\n\n\nCode\n#####################\n### Load Packages ###\n#####################\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n#################\n### Load Data ###\n#################\n\nround2 &lt;- read.csv(\"../../../../../Data/Pacific_oysters/2024_08_22_Survivorship_Round2.csv\")\n\n####################\n### Data Munging ###\n####################\n\n# Convert mort_date to Date format\nround2 &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(mort_date = as.Date(mort_date, format=\"%m/%d/%Y\"))\n\n# Calculate the total number of original samples in each group\ngroup_totals &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_samples = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Generate a sequence of dates covering the entire period\ndate_seq &lt;- seq(min(round2$mort_date, na.rm = TRUE), max(round2$mort_date, na.rm = TRUE), by = \"day\")\n# Add the date before start of experiment, to show original 0% mortality\ndate_seq &lt;- c(as.Date(\"2024-08-08\"), date_seq)\n\n# Create a data frame with all combinations of treatment group and date\nround2_full &lt;- expand.grid(group = unique(round2$group), \n                           date = date_seq)\n\n# Aggregate the data by group and date to get daily death counts\nround2_daily &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(group, mort_date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(deaths = n(), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  rename(date = mort_date)\n\n# Join the aggregated daily deaths with the full date range\nround2_cumulative &lt;- round2_full %&gt;%\n  left_join(round2_daily, by = c(\"group\", \"date\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(deaths = ifelse(is.na(deaths), 0, deaths)) %&gt;%  # Replace NA with 0 for days with no deaths\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(cumulative_deaths = cumsum(deaths)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Join with group totals to calculate cumulative deaths as a percentage\nround2_cumulative &lt;- round2_cumulative %&gt;%\n  left_join(group_totals, by = \"group\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(cumulative_death_percentage = (cumulative_deaths / total_samples) * 100)\n\n# retrieve metadata associated with groups\nmetadata &lt;- round2 %&gt;%\n  select(group, cattle_tag, round1_treatment, round2_treatment) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\nround2_cumulative_metadata &lt;- round2_cumulative %&gt;%\n  left_join(metadata, by = \"group\")\n\n################\n### Plot Data ##\n################\n\nlabels_df &lt;- round2_cumulative_metadata %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  filter(date == max(date)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(round2_cumulative_metadata, aes(x = date, y = cumulative_death_percentage, group = group, color = round1_treatment)) +\n  #geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ round2_treatment) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = labels_df, aes(label = group), size = 2.5, nudge_x = 0.3, check_overlap = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative mortality from Survivorship Round 2\",\n       x = \"Time\",\n       y = \"Cumulative mortality (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceted by Round 2 treatment, color indicates Round 1 treatment (i.e. “second hardening”)"

    "text": "Notes from 4/10 meeting with Andrea to discuss SIFP fellowship this summer\nAction Items:\nTenure dates. Proposal stated 07/01/2025 - 09/12/2025.\n\nThis works for Andrea!\n\nBudgeting and sourcing research funds. What is estimated cost of project (see here for breakdown of sequencing costs) and how will Andrea and/or Steven be supporting with funding?\n\nMaterials and reagents for extraction and QC are largely/fully available through the LAB communal resources, so library prep and sequencing are the only costs.\n200ng (minimum for Nanopore Rapid Barcoding Kit) is a totally feasible DNA quantity. Need to consider though that the DNA will be “dirty,” containing mold, symbiont, etc. Need to consider how to clean up and how much total DNA we need to get 200ng of coral DNA.\nLAB doesn’t seem to have a nanopore sequencing platform, so we may need to send samples out for sequencing. Need to look into how cost will change. Can still be kept low with multiplexing though.\nMinION vs. PromethION?\nAndrea is working with a NOAA scientist, Dan, who is experienced with nanopore sequencing and interested in using it more. Andrea will set up a meeting w him to discuss sequencing options.\nAndrea can fully support with research funding, and will thus be senior author on resultant papers (notify Steven)\n\nHow/when to begin sourcing specimens? Does Andrea have an inventory database of some kind so I can begin looking for suitable species and collections dates?\n\nFocus on dried specimens, since they yield better DNA quality/quantity than wet-stored. Andrea’s been seeing higher DNA yield from octocorals than stony, but octocorals potentially less interesting for enviornmental resilience questions.\nSince multiplexing will likely keep sequencing costs lows, maybe we could do 15 stony and 15 octo?\nGBR and maybe Carribean for sourcing old specimens. Maybe we can just use the same specimens as in Connelly, Catapang, and Quattrini (2024) , since we know many yielded sufficient DNA for sequencing. None are type specimens, so additional sampling would likely be fine.\nmuseum inventory: https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/iz/\n\nProject timeline.\n\nlikely need 1 week for setup, maybe 2 weeks for first round of extractions/QC. Unsure what the sequencing timeline will be if we have to send it out, but the a PromethION sequencing run takes ~3 days.\nIdeally I’d get a full round of samples sequenced in first 5 weeks, then be able to do a second round (e.g. work out the kinks with the higher-yield octocoral samples, then try for stony samples)\n\nExtra from 4/10 Lab Meeting, talking w Shelly:\n\nContact ONT! They may be able to provide guidance on workflow modifications for using low quantity/quality DNA\nWinston Timp, works in developing sequencing tech and has done lots with Nanopore tech. Can try looking through his related publications or contacting (can use Shelly as contact)\nAdaptive sampling\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nConnelly, Michael T., Mary Grace Catapang, and Andrea M.

Using a PromethION.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nUsed Ligation kit instead of Rapid, because Rapid is optimized for longer reads, have not tried Rapid. Note that they did not multiplex, so they were using the Ligation kit without barcoding. They also had way less DNA than recommended for the kit (&lt;100ng compared to the recommended 1000ng).\nFor them, adaptive sequencing was not helpful in identifying the short reads. However, they haven’t tried using it as an depletion step to exclude known contaminant sequences. Not entirely sure how software would respond to the short reads – would it try to reject them?\nSuggest standard genomic sequencing as a QC step to identify which samples have the most endogenous content. Could this be done in-house at the Smithsonian?\nIn contrast to Dan’s experience (presumably with amplified DNA), they’ve noted their unamplified libraries are not stable. With the ligation kit, they’ve (anecdotally) had ~1hr to get a prepped library to sequencing. They would strongly recommend we stick with the available MinION, instead of looking for an outside PromethION, because of the risks of library degradation.\nThey’ve noted that the flow cells can be finniky – differences in number of functioning pores, pores degrade quickly, etc. Wash step helps output but still issues.\nBeen observing 5-8X coverage to call methlation with some confidence. They’ve also been working with modern comparisons, and the biggest difference in ancient vs modern samples for methylation calling was coverage. Haven’t noted any major differences introduced by fragmented input.\nBiggest issue is that their coverage is spotty – they get no data for some regions and lots of data for others – and that their genome isn’t fully annotated, so they have little context for some of their coverage.\nSize select: They haven’t been implementing for nanopore, but have for normal Illumina. Using Pippin, better with short reads than bead. Does Rapid Kit already incorporate a size selection?\nSawyer 2024 compared EMseq and WGBS for ancient samples, and concluded that WGBS is better for ancient.\nOverall, the Nanopore sequencing works – they got data – but it just hasn’t been cost effective for them. They’re going to be trying WGBS soon. Noted that they also don’t know much about other attempts to use Nanopore for aDNA/hDNA methylation mapping, or about how it compares to WGBS/EMSeq. They’ve heard anecdotally about other labs considering, but there are just no published results (or negative results).\nNote: they were working with very little DNA (maybe 100ng), highly fragmented, and for a species with a large genome (~3Gb, close to a human).\nWe may have more success/it may be more cost effective since we have newer/potentially better-preserved specimens, and the genomes are so much shorter. While they were unable to incorporate multiplexing, we likely can with success. Suggested running a single sample on its own flow cell first to get a sense of how much output/coverage we’ll get. Flongle for this?\n\n\n\nTakeaways:\n\nShould use Ligation Kit instead of Rapid. Rapid is optimized for longer reads. It also includes “transposase chemistry” which seems to perform some type of DNA shearing, which we don’t want with our fragmented reads.\n\nNative Barcoding Kit 24 is same price as Rapid Barcoding Kit 24\nONT reccommends Rapid Kit not be used with fragments &lt;500nt\n\nStick with the MinION\nHaving a well-annotated genome is important, so keep that in mind when selecting samples.\nPrioritize the QC steps to select samples with as much long-read, endogenous DNA as possible\n\nPaper on optemizing short-read sequencing using a MinION and Rapid Barcoding Kit: https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/8/5/1649/6028073\nONT Document on recommendations for sample quantity/quality: https://nanoporetech.com/document/input-dna-rna-qc"

The criteria are:\n\nOctocoral species, since these have generally extracted better for Andrea than old stony corals\n\n\n\nSpecimens available for a range of collection dates spanning ~100 years, including a modern collection (within the last ~20 years)\nA well-annotated genome is available for the species (or a very close relative)\n\nWith these criteria in mind, Andrea suggested a few octocoral species that have high-quality genome annotations:\n\nEunicea knighti: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_965233905.1/\nLeptogorgia sarmentosa: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_964658295.1/\nGorgonia ventalina: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_964194065.1/\n\n\nInventory search\nFor Eunicea and Leptogorgia, the museum doesn’t have significant collection of the species with annotated genomes. However, they may have more abundant material from a close relative. To check this, I searched the collections inventory for the two genera, including a filter for only collections that were preserved and stored “Dry”, and downloaded the results as CSVs.

This might be an ideal “middle” timepoint.\nThe only “modern” collections I see are 6 specimens collected in in the last 25 years (2000, 2002, 2004, and 2019), and they’re all very small, just a couple inches in length and not fully branching. I’d have to be very careful and judicious when subsampling these.\n\nE. tourneforti\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the museum database, there are two different attributions used for E. tourneforti:\n\nEunicea tourneforti atra Verrill, 1901\n\n\n\nEunicea tourneforti tourneforti Milne Edwards & Haime, 1857\n\nIs there a difference? Has the species been revised?\n\n\n\nE. tourneforti may be a better Eunicea species to work with because it is more closely related to the species for which we have a high-quality genome, E. knighti (Sarmiento et al. (2025))\n\n\n\nEunicea phylogeny (maximum likelihood, based on reduced representation sequencing) (Sarmiento et al. 2025)\n\n\nThe branches of E. tournefortini are much thicker than those of E. flexuosa, which may prove beneficial for successfully extracting DNA\nSeveral specimens (5-10) from the turn of the century, all of a good size (6-12 inches in length, branching)\n~30 specimens from 1960s and 1970s, all with plenty of material (~1ft in length, branching). As with E. flexuosa, this seems like an ideal “mid-age” timepoint.\n6 from early 2000s collections (2002, 2009). All are quite small, just a few inches in length and not very branched. Two, however, are quite thick, so contain more material.\nAnother 6 from 2019 collection (thanks Prof McFadden!). As in others, these specimens are short (~3 inches) and unbranched, but much thicker than the E. flexuosa counterparts. One is actually a bit larger too, ~6 inches long and forked.\n\nG. ventalina\n\nLittle material from turn-of the century. I saw 2 specimens from before 1900, and both were very small, maybe 2 inches in diameter – I would be really worried about destructively sampling these, expecially because the lacy growth form of G. ventalina means there’s less tissue by surface area, so I may need to take more. There were 3 specimens from early 1900s, and these were larger (6-12 inches in diameter). One, however, was almost white – a contrast to the dark purple color of the other specimens – which suggested to me it may have either been treated (i.e. bleached) or more degraded.\nAs in the other species, plenty of specimens (30-40) and material (~1ft in diameter) from the 1960s and 70s.\nVery little modern material, I only saw 2-3 small specimens from the early 2000s.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nWe don’t have a sufficient range of collection dates of any Leptogorgia species, and both the very old and very recent specimens of G. ventalina are potentially too small for subsampling. This leaves one of the Eunicea species, using the E. knighti genome as reference. Both E. flexuosa and E. tourneforti have sufficient material from an appropriate range of collection dates. However, E. tourneforti is more closely related to our reference E. knighti; has more specimens and material available for the critical modern reference; and is thicker, potentially providing more tissue for extraction. Because of these considerations, I think E. tourneforti is the best choice!\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nSarmiento, Adriana, Iván Calixto-Botía, Tatiana Julio-Rodríguez, Andrea M. Quattrini, and Juan A.

I then calculated, for each sample, what bead volume to use to maintain a bead-to-sample ratio of 0.7X.\n\n\n\n8X tube strip\nCatalog #\nDNA (uL)\nBeads (uL)\n\n\n\n\nA\n14366 *\n90\n63\n\n\nA\n19054 *\n100\n70\n\n\nA\n52295 *\n100\n70\n\n\nA\n1180630 *\n110\n77\n\n\nA\n50603 *\n110\n77\n\n\nA\n51732 +\n100\n70\n\n\nA\n51892 +\n90\n63\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n14399\n55\n38.5\n\n\nB\n42137\n50\n35\n\n\nB\n51730\n70\n49\n\n\nB\n51782\n45\n31.5\n\n\nB\n100609\n45\n31.5\n\n\nB\n100610\n45\n31.5\n\n\nB\n1007393\n45\n31.5\n\n\nB\n1018355\n55\n38.5\n\n\nC\n1606824\n50\n35\n\n\nC\n1606826\n55\n38.5\n\n\nC\n1740336\n55\n38.5\n\n\nC\n1740363\n50\n35\n\n\nC\n1740390\n45\n31.5\n\n\nC\n1740407\n65\n45.5\n\n\nC\n50368\n50\n35\n\n\nC\n51727\n50\n35\n\n\nD\n51729\n45\n31.5\n\n\nD\n51857\n45\n31.5\n\n\nD\n51858\n45\n31.5\n\n\nD\n51859\n45\n31.5\n\n\nD\n51860\n40\n28\n\n\nD\n51861\n30\n21\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter pipetting all samples into 8X tube strips (in the same order as shown in the volume table above), I filled 4 8X tube strips with the corresponding volumes of KAPA Pure Beads (temp-acclimated and vortexed).

The protocol is likely optimized for multiplexing a large number of samples at once, but I’m just using 4.\nI think I should be able to, instead, carry-over a full 3.75uL of end-prepped DNA at this step, and exclude additional nuclease-free water.

Dan suggested this may be due to loading too little DNA, so we decided to try spiking in more library at a higher concentration, without washing the flow cell.\nI made a dilution of G1L4 at double the recommended concentration:\nRecommended: 100fmol = 43.1ng\nDoubled: 200fmol = 86.2ng\nSo I need 86.2ng DNA in 12uL EB.\n\\(\\frac{86.2ng\\ DNA}{36.6\\frac{ng}{uL}} = 2.4uL\\ G1L4\\)\nSo added 2.4ng G1L4 to (12-2.4) = 9.6uL EB.\nPrepared the second load as instructed in protocol (SB, LIB, and 2X concentration G1L4 dilution). Paused MinION run at 17minutes and added full 75uL of second library to the SpotOn port in dropwise fashion (opened priming port first to create negative pressure). Library was absorbed into cell as desired.\nUn-paused run, and it resumed as normal. Pore occupancy steadily increased. by minute 30, ~75% of available pores were sequencing – the spike of second library was successful!"

    "text": "G2L2 flow cell issues\nI checked the sequencing run of Group 2 Library 2 (G2L2) on a MinION flow cell (ID# FBD39370) 13 hours in and observed some weird issues:\n\nLow output. 13 hours in, the G2L2 run had produced 820Mb of output.\nFor comparison, by 13 hours into the Group1 Library 4 (G1L4) MinION run, there was ~3.5Gb output.\nThe G2L2 run actually had a roughly equivalent number of starting pores and a higher proportion of available pores sequencing in the first half hour, so I expected higher output if anything. The low output was surprising.\nFast pore loss. By the 13 hour mark, the G2L2 run had dropped from an initial 1397 pores (1482 prior to loading) to 224 pores – an 84% drop .\n\n\nFor comparison, the G1L4 run began with 1383 pores after loading and 668 pores at the 12.5hr pore scan (a 52% drop). Neither run had been washed at this point.\n\nAccumulation/reclamation patterns of pores in the “Channel Disabled” state. Looking at the Pore Activity chart, with the “Show more” option, I saw that, in the G2L2 run, there was a gradual accumulation of pores in the “Channel Disabled” category until a pore scan, at which time most “Channel Disabled” pores would be returned to a variety of states, mostly to “No Pore”. This accumulation of “Channel Disabled” pores would then begin again until the next pore scan, etc. The percentage of pores in this catgory would generally increase from ~2% to 25%-30% between pore scans, before “resetting”.\n\nLooking back at the G1L4 run, this pattern is also present, but it’s not as dramatic. The percentage of pores in the “Channel Disabled” category never rose above ~14%. in the first 13hrs.\n\nI also noticed that the percentage of pores in the “Active Feedback” category was notably higher in this G2L2 run than in the G1L4 run.\n\nThe “Channel Disabled” category is not well defined in the MinKnow interface, it’s just labelled as “Channel is disabled and awaiting another pore scan”. There’s no information on what might be causing an accumulation of disabled pores. Google wasn’t very helpful either in trying to find more detailed documentation on what accumulation of pores in the “channel disabled” category might represent. Upon searching “nanopore ‘channel disabled’,” the top results were ONT documentation on the MinKnow software with the same short description of the category – “channel is disabled and awaiting another pore scan”.\n\n\nWildflower flow cells\nHowever, Google did turn up one other promising search result: David Eccles’ GrinGene Bioinformatics site, with his comprehensive, multi-year compilation of experiences/insights into Nanopore sequencing! There is a ton of material here that looks really useful, but the section that caught the attention of my Google search is as follows (emphasis added):\n\n2023-Mar-09\nWildflower flow cell patterns\nAs I’ve reported briefly in the past, we’ve been seeing a lot of R9.4.1 flow cells with what I like to call a “wildflower” pattern, because the detailed channel plot looks a bit like a field of wildflowers, with a large mix of different types of channel classification and no obvious pattern.\nWhat happens with these flow cells is that they tend to crash quickly. We see steep decreases in sequencing capacity, in this most recent case losing about 50% of sequencing capacity overnight, despite having a well-loaded flow cell (this was with a rapid adapter cDNA kit; it’s quite rare for us to see loading over about 75%). I’ve noticed that this sharp decrease is commonly linked to the “active feedback” and “channel disabled” pore states.\nThis looks quite different from the more homogeneous channel state that we expect to see on flow cells (here shown is a reasonably good channel state image; I think this was prior to loading anything on the flow cell, which is why the total read count is so low).\nUnfortunately, the wildflower pattern isn’t recognised as bad in the initial flow cell QC check (the QC message for the first flow cell was “Flow Cell FAT13376 has 1059 pores available for sequencing”), and it’s only once we start sequencing that we notice this bad patterning.\nI haven’t yet worked out why this is happening, but it’s not to do with sample prep. In the past, we have seen the same effect from flow cells when there’s nothing loaded on them, and also prior to loading any priming mix (i.e. when doing a 5 minute sequencing run before doing any priming). This does mean that we can do an additional channel state QC prior to priming to identify these cells... but we need to remember to do that.\nIt also doesn’t seem to be related to storage time (we’ve had this happen on flow cells that were checked the day after they arrived) or shipping conditions (about a year ago we had two flow cells that had a long stopover in Australia, one of which exhibited this problem, one which didn’t).\nIt has been challenging discussing this issue over email with ONT in the past, because every support email seems to end up with a different person. They aren’t generally aware of this problem, so almost always fall back on it being a sample loading issue (which is certainly not the case in situations where we haven’t done priming or loading). This means it can be a challenge getting replacements for these flow cells: they’re showing fine on the initial count-based QC, so don’t count as poor quality as part of the standard “fewer questions asked” warranty replacement.\nThis does seem to be more of an issue currently with R9.4.1 flow cells, but I thought I’d do a more full writeup just in case it ends up as an issue with R10.4.1 flow cells later on.\n\nWowza! David’s description of what he terms “wildflower” flow cells sounds really similar to this low-quality run, including inital high pore counts, fast pore loss despite properly loading the flow cell, and weird signatures of “channel disabled” and “active feedback” pore states. When I checked the Channel States panel for my G2L2 run, I observed the “wildflower” pattern David described.\n\n\n\nG2L2 Channel States panel\n\n\nI also noted that David’s description of “losing about 50% of sequencing capacity overnight, despite having a well-loaded flow cell” would also be similar to the G1L4 MinION run, which lost &gt;50% of active pores in the first 12 hours. The G1L4 flow cell also exhibited a pattern of “channel disabled” pore accumulation and reclamation, though it was less pronounced than in the G2L2 run. I can’t view the progression of the Channel States panel after-the-fact, so I can’t look for the “wildflower” pattern in the G1L4 flow cell, but it seems possible this run was also compromised.\nLater entries to the site indicate that David observed the same issues with R10 flow cells after their release. I also then looked through the Nanopore Community forum and found a long thread, also initiated by David Eccles, on the issue of “wildflower” flow cells. Viewing the thread requires having a Nanopore account, so here’s a pdf copy (though the images saved a little wonky). It seems many people observe that MinION and PromethION flow cells run on any sequencing platform (MinION, GridION, or PromethION) occasionally exhibit the same sequencing patterns described above and die quickly with little output.\n\nAdditional Nanopore community forum threads with examples of wildflower cells:\nhttps://community.nanoporetech.com/posts/flow-cell-health-worsening\nhttps://community.nanoporetech.com/posts/underloaded-flow-cell-ho\nhttps://community.nanoporetech.com/posts/large-proportion-of-the-po\n\n\nExamples of wildflower flow cells\nExample images pulled from David Eccles’ Nanopore Community thread on the issue\n\n\nAnother example, first of the channel states before priming or loading any sample, and then after:\n\n\nExample of a “good” flow cell’s Channel States:\n\nThe community consensus, after observations of “wildflower” cells with a variety of ages, storage conditions, library kits, data types, and loading states, is that the cells themselves are dysfunctional, and the pattern is not the result of user error. Unfortunately, since the issue is usually only caught after a sequencing run has been initiated, ONT is apparently very reluctant to acknowledge that it’s a flow cell issue. Consequently, it’s apparently been difficult to obtain troubleshooting support or replacement flow cells.\n\n\n\nNext steps\nOne of the comments in the above Nanopore community thread indicated instances of receiving several “wildflower” flow cells from the same LOT of MinION flow cells:\n\nWe expected that this issue would have been fixed with the R10.4.1. However, we have come across several flow cells still displaying this pattern. Fortunately, for the time being, it seems to be confined to a specific LOT that we had.\nAlbert Carcereny, 2 years ago\n\nUnfortunately, that means it’s quite possible I’ll have more defunct cells, since all five of the MinION flow cells I received came from the same LOT (11004308).\nFrom now on, I will add an additional flow cell QC step before priming and loading the flow cells. After inserting the flow cell, I will start the sequencing run without priming (adding FCF+FCT) or loading (adding SB+DNA+LIB), and let it run for ~5min. This will perform an initial pore scan and show me the pores’ status, without introducing the possibility of user error. If I observe the “wildflower” pattern in the Channel States panel during this QC, I’ll have much stronger evidence that the flow cell itself is defective, and may be able to get a replacement from ONT – in that case I’ll need to take a screenshot of the Channel States panel for supporting evidence. After this QC step, I can pause the run, prime and load the flow cell as normal, and resume the run to begin sequencing my library. Even if the flow cell is a “wildflower” cell, I can get some usable data off of it, and ONT doesn’t require you to return defective flow cells to receive a replacement.\nI’ve also reached out to Nanopore Customer Support to try to get a replacement MinION flow cell, which is unlikely but worth a try.

I was originally concerned that, by increasing the quantity of DNA retained through end-prep, I’d “overloaded” the adapter ligation step, resulting in a high proportion of un-adapted DNA. I thought this unadapted DNA might then be lowering the effective library concentration, resulting in low occupancy.\nHowever, after some discussion in a Nanopore community forum thread with David Eccles, I don’t think adapters are the issue. Instead, David suggested the problem may lay with the short reads “leaving the pores hanging,” and taking too long for a given pore to “find” a new read to sequence. His recommendation was to spike in some longer control DNA. My timeline is too short to order any additional lambda phage DNA, but I can use the DNA Control Sample (DCS) provided in the Native Barcoding Kit (~3.6kb).\nWith this re-introduction of DCS to the library prep protocol, I need to re-do the Group 2 library.\n\n\n\nCatalog #\nConc.
